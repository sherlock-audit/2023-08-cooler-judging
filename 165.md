# Lenders can force borrowers to get defaulted
## Summary
Lenders can `clearRequest` any loan and force the borrower to default and take their collateral, in the cases where it is advantageous for them.
## Vulnerability Detail
After a `Cooler` is created, a borrower can `requestLoan` specifying the `amount` he wants to borrow and also the `loanToCollateral` amount he intends to supply the escrow as collateral

After that any lender can call `clearRequest` to supply the specific amount and create a `loan` which need to be paid by the borrower and if that is not the case, the lender can claim the collateral that the borrower provided.

The problem relies in the fact that any lender can use the `isCallback` boolean to force the borrower to default and take his collateral, so a malicious person can search for any advantageous debt/collateral requests and gain a profit from every lend he does.
Let's take this simple scenario : 
- Alice wants to `requestLoan` and uses a `loanToCollateral` value that will be advantageous for the lenders, in case of default, so more lenders will come to borrow her
- Bob sees the advantageous `request` and calls `clearRequest` with `isCallback_` to true to specify that he is using the `CoolerCallback` abstract, but in reality he only implements `isCoolerCallback` and `onDefault` from `CoolerCallback`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/CoolerCallback.sol#L41-L45
- Because Bob maliciously implemented only those 2 functions in his contract, any time Alice tries to call `repayLoan` to pay her debt, the last external call on Bob contract would fail because there is no function signature `onRepay`, and since the signature doesn't exist the call will just revert
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol#L185
- After the loan expire , Bob calls `claimDefaulted` and takes of the collateral that Alice provided
- He can repeat that every time he can get a profit out of collateral/debt ratio
## Impact
Impact is a high one and the probability of it happening is high, since it is very easy to create a contract implementing only those 2 functions, making it a high.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
You give too much power to the lender by letting him to force external calls to his contract, he can easily use this to his advantage and implement only specific functions to force things happening the way the wants. Consider to change the whole `callback` mechanic since it can be very easily abusable in a trustless scenario.
