# Frontrun protection on `rollLoan`
## Summary

Currently, the peer to peer flow (not through the ClearingHouse) for rolling is for a lender to call `provideNewTermsForRoll` and then for the borrower to call `rollLoan`. The lender can initially call `provideNewTermsForRoll` with nice parameters, trick the borrower into calling `rollLoan`, and then front-run their call to `rollLoan` with a call to `provideNewTermsForRoll` with bad parameters.  

## Vulnerability Detail

Note that the `collateral().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newCollateral);` doesn't actually cause a revert in the case of front-running (e.g., raising the interest rate to something really high in the front-run transaction wouldn't change the amount of additional collateral required). 

Note that this is not an issue for users taking and rolling loans directly from the ClearingHouse, since the clearing house will provide the roll terms with the governance issued parameters and then call `rollLoan` for you. This only affects the peer to peer case where an external, non-ClearingHouse lender and borrower want to agree to `rollLoan`. 

## Impact

Borrower could be stuck with a bad loan (worst case, their loan defaults and they lose their collateral)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommendation is to add a `req_id` field to `Request` that is incremented every time the request is changed. Then have that passed to `rollLoan` as well and check it to make sure there was no front-running.
