# Bad debt caused by fixed loan to collateral value
## Summary

Loans given by the ClearingHouse have a fixed loan to collateral value, which could lead to losses for the treasury / Clearing House in the event that gOHM price is below 3000. 

## Vulnerability Detail

There is a fixed loan to collateral value for loans given by the ClearingHouse in `ClearingHouse.sol`: 

`uint256 public constant LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL = 3000e18;       // 3,000 DAI/gOHM`

Whenever gOHM price is less than 3000 DAI, this will lead to users buying gOHM off the market, requesting a loan from the ClearingHouse and using the gOHM as collateral, and then never paying the loan back, thus making a profit and incurring a loss for the treasury. 

## Impact

The treasury / Clearing House will lose money to defaulted loans whenever gOHM price is less than 3000.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use some type of price feed and add some type of margin to reduce the probability of losses (e.g. make the LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL value the fair price of gOHM from the price feed + 5% or so).
