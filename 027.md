# CoolerFactory.sol allows deployment of coolers with non-authentic collateral_ and debt_ tokens
## Summary
CoolerFactory.sol allows deployment of coolers with non-authentic collateral_ and debt_ tokens

## Vulnerability Detail
The generateCooler() function allows creates a new Escrow contract for collateral and debt tokens. 

```Solidity

    function generateCooler(ERC20 collateral_, ERC20 debt_) external returns (address cooler) {
        // Return address if cooler exists.
        cooler = coolerFor[msg.sender][collateral_][debt_];

        // Otherwise generate new cooler.
        if (cooler == address(0)) {
            // Clone the cooler implementation.
            bytes memory coolerData = abi.encodePacked(
                msg.sender,              // owner
                address(collateral_),    // collateral
                address(debt_),          // debt
                address(this)            // factory
            );
            cooler = address(coolerImplementation).clone(coolerData);

            // Update storage accordingly.
            coolerFor[msg.sender][collateral_][debt_] = cooler;
            coolersFor[collateral_][debt_].push(cooler);
            created[cooler] = true;
        }
    }
```

CoolerFactory.sol contract maintains a mapping to verify that a cooler has been deployed via the factory.

```Solidity

    /// @notice Mapping to validate deployed coolers.
    mapping(address => bool) public created;
```

This allows users to check the authenticity of a cooler to ensure the that implementation of a cooler is authentic and that means the cooler is not malicious.

CoolerFactory.sol contract also maintains a mapping to check the duplication of coolers,

```Solidity

    /// @notice Mapping to prevent duplicate coolers.
    mapping(address => mapping(ERC20 => mapping(ERC20 => address))) private coolerFor;
```

The issue here is about the the implementation of collateral_ and debt_ tokens being the authentic or not phoney contract addresses. Otherwise, a malicious actor could deploy cooler via the CoolerFactory.sol and provide malicious collateral_ and debt_  contract addresses. In the current implementation, users are be able to check the authenticity of a coolers, but not the authenticity of the collateral_ and debt_ tokens a cooler has been integrated with.

## Impact
A malicious cooler can be deployed via CoolerFactory.sol contract. Users may lose funds while interacting with such coolers.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider whitlisting the collateral_ and debt_ token addresses to safeguard users and to prevent malicious actor from using phoney addresses.
