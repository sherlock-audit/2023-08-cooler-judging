# Protocol won't work with tokens that can prevent transfers
## Summary
There are various tokens  and token standards that can result in transfers being stopped, blocked, blacklisted, paused or disallowed. This entails protocols may function well with these tokens up until a time when any of above measures activated leading to inability to perform transfers of these tokens into and out of the protocol

[Cooler allows for user defined debt collateral token pairs CoolerFactory.sol line 58](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/CoolerFactory.sol#L58C5-L58C96)
```solidity
function generateCooler(ERC20 collateral_, ERC20 debt_) external returns (address cooler) {
```

## Vulnerability Detail
Tokens such as ERC20Pausable, Pausable Tokens like WBTC,  ERC1400, Polymath like tokens; it implies the all instances mentioned in the links provided will not function for transfers. Whats worse is tokens with blacklisting capabilities may block contract addresses of protocol which renders them incapable to send and receive these tokens to function fully.

## Impact
If such tokens active their blocking, pause, prevent transfer, blakclist capability the protocol will not work, lending and borrowing is no longer possible, transfers of users funds cant not happen. 

## Code Snippet
```solidity
// Cooler.sol line 117 
collateral().safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            collateralFor(amount_, loanToCollateral_)
        );

// Cooler.sol line 138
collateral().safeTransfer(owner(), collateralFor(req.amount, req.loanToCollateral));

// Cooler.sol line 178, 179
 debt().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, repayTo, repaid_);
 collateral().safeTransfer(owner(), collateralized);

// Cooler.sol line 212
collateral().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newCollateral);

//Cooler.so line 271 
debt().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, owner(), req.amount);

//Cooler.sol line 312
debt().safeTransfer(loan.lender, claim);

//Cooler.sol line 325
collateral().safeTransfer(loan.lender, loan.collateral);

```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended such tokens be disallowed from being used with the protocol
Consider a whitelist of allowed tokens
