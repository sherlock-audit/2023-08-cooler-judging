# Collateral Transfer and Loan Request issue
## Summary
```solidity
gOHM.approve(address(cooler_), collateral);
uint256 reqID = cooler_.requestLoan(amount_, INTEREST_RATE, LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL, DURATION);
```
the approve function is used to allow the cooler_ contract to transfer collateral amount of gOHM tokens on behalf of the user. The issue arises due to the lack of specific allowance amount and the immediate subsequent requestLoan function call.
## Vulnerability Detail
the vulnerable part in code : 
```solidity
    /// @notice Lend to a cooler.
    /// @dev    To simplify the UX and easily ensure that all holders get the same terms,
    ///         this function requests a new loan and clears it in the same transaction.
    /// @param  cooler_ to lend to.
    /// @param  amount_ of DAI to lend.
    /// @return the id of the granted loan.
    function lendToCooler(Cooler cooler_, uint256 amount_) external returns (uint256) {
        // Attempt a clearinghouse <> treasury rebalance.
        rebalance();
        // Validate that cooler was deployed by the trusted factory.
        if (!factory.created(address(cooler_))) revert OnlyFromFactory();
        // Validate cooler collateral and debt tokens.
        if (cooler_.collateral() != gOHM || cooler_.debt() != dai) revert BadEscrow();

        // Compute and access collateral. Increment loan receivables.
        uint256 collateral = cooler_.collateralFor(amount_, LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL);
        receivables += debtForCollateral(collateral);
        gOHM.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), collateral);

        // Create a new loan request.
        gOHM.approve(address(cooler_), collateral);
        uint256 reqID = cooler_.requestLoan(amount_, INTEREST_RATE, LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL, DURATION);

        // Clear the created loan request by providing enough DAI.
        sdai.withdraw(amount_, address(this), address(this));
        dai.approve(address(cooler_), amount_);
        uint256 loanID = cooler_.clearRequest(reqID, true, true);
        
        return loanID;
    }

    /// @notice Rollover an existing loan.
    /// @dev    To simplify the UX and easily ensure that all holders get the same terms,
    ///         this function provides the governance-approved terms for a rollover and
    ///         does the loan rollover in the same transaction.
    /// @param  cooler_ to provide terms.
    /// @param  loanID_ of loan in cooler.
```
Here is a scenario show Alice's collateral is stolen by the attacker Eve :
- Alice, a user, wants to lend DAI to the Cooler contract and uses the lendToCooler function.
- She approves a certain amount of gOHM tokens as collateral by calling gOHM.approve(address(cooler_), collateral);.
- Before the transaction gets mined, an attacker (Eve) monitors the Ethereum mempool for pending transactions.
- Eve detects Alice's pending transaction and identifies that it contains the approve call followed by the requestLoan call.
- Eve quickly crafts a malicious transaction to transfer the approved collateral amount to her malicious address.
- She sets a higher gas price for her transaction to ensure it gets mined before Alice's transaction.
- Miners pick up Eve's transaction due to the higher gas price, and the collateral is transferred to Eve's address.
- Alice's transaction is mined, executing the requestLoan call, but now her collateral has already been maliciously transferred.
## Impact
the approve function call doesn't specify an allowance amount, it can be exploited between the approve call and the subsequent requestLoan call. An attacker could monitor the blockchain for such transactions and insert a transaction that transfers the allowed amount of collateral to a malicious address before the original requestLoan transaction gets mined. This would lead to the loss of collateral without a loan being created.

## Recommendation
Use SafeERC20's safeApprove AS :
`SafeERC20.safeApprove(gOHM, address(cooler_), collateral);`
