# Cooler.sol#repayLoan() - Tokens that use blacklists can brick `repayLoan` if `loan.lender` is blacklisted address. This way the` loan.lender` can force a default on a loan as `repayLoan` will always revert.
## Summary
Tokens that use blacklists can brick `repayLoan` if `loan.lender` is blacklisted address. This way the `loan.lender` can force a default on a loan as `repayLoan` will always revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
Some `ERC20` tokens have blacklists `(USDC, USDT)`. A transfer to/from those addresses will revert the tx.

This [issue was reported in the last audit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler-judging/issues/23) and was confirmed, but the fix implemented doesn't fix the problem, it just makes it a bit more complicated. 

The 'fix' is when a `lender` calls `clearRequest` he can specify if he wants the loan to be repaid directly or not. If `repayDirect_ = true`, when the `borrower` calls `repayLoan` the `debt` tokens will be sent directly to the `loan.lender`. If `repayDirect_ = false` the funds will be escrowed in the `Cooler` and then the `lender` will have to call `claimRepaid` to receive the escrowed tokens.

The issue occurs that even if originally `repayDirect_ = false`, the `lender` can still call `setDirectRepay(loanId, true)` to set the payment method to be directly to his address. This is a problem, as a malicious `lender` can be blacklisted and front-run the `borrower's` `repayLoan` tx with `setDirectRepay(loanId, true)`, setting the `repayTo` variable inside `repayLoan` to his address just before the `borrower's` tx goes through. 

Example:
1. Bob (borrower) `requestLoan` for some USDC tokens.
2. Alice (malicious) decides to `clearRequest` for the specific loan that Bob wants. Alice knows that her address is blacklisted in USDC so she sets `repayDirect_ = false`.
3. Time passes and Bob is ready to `repayLoan` and calls it.
4. Alice front-runs Bob and calls 'setDirectRepay(loanId, true)', effectively setting the `repayTo` variable inside `repayLoan` to her address.
5. Bob's `repayLoan` tx will revert, as Alice is blacklisted in USDC.
6. Bob's loan can never be repaid and will be defaulted after it expires.

Another scenario can be where Alice `transferOwnership` to a blacklisted address. The effect will be the same.

The sponsor commented that people can use `CoolerFactory` and `Cooler` for other tokens different than `DAI, sDAI and gOHM` if they wanted to and they can build a UI around them, so I consider this a valid issue in this case.

## Impact
The lender can a force a loan to default.

## Code Snippet
```javascript
// File: src/Cooler.sol : Cooler.   #1
151       function repayLoan(uint256 loanID_, uint256 repaid_) external returns (uint256) {
...
177       // Transfer repaid debt back to the lender and (de)collateral back to the owner.
178 @>    debt().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, repayTo, repaid_);
179       collateral().safeTransfer(owner(), decollateralized);

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Completely remove `setDirectRepay` and only transfer `debt` tokens to the `Cooler`. This way the `lender` will only get the tokens through `claimRepaid`.
