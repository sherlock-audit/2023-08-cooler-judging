# Lack of safeguards to ensure pair arrays used together ordered correctly
## Summary
Arrays are used in tandem together as they are supposed to be paired based on their index, however there is no safeguard that such is the case 

## Vulnerability Detail
In  [function claimDefaulted(address[] calldata coolers_, uint256[] calldata loans_) external {...  ClearingHouse.sol line 191] (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Clearinghouse.sol#L191) two separate arrays that will be used together in synchrony are supplied. However there is no safeguard that they are ordered correctly such that coolers[i] is the correct address to batchClaim for loan Id loans_[i] . 

## Impact
If the ordering is incorrect this results in batchClaiming no working as expected, claiming from wrong ids when thinking claiming has been done right ids, claiming from wrong coolers when thinking claiming from right coolers, potential reverts due to mismatches as process done in a loop if one fails all others fail etc 

## Code Snippet
// ClearingHouse.sol from lines 204 in function claimDefaulted()
```solidity 
            // Claim defaults and update cached metrics.
            (uint256 debt, uint256 collateral, uint256 elapsed) = Cooler(coolers_[i]).claimDefaulted(loans_[i]);
            uint256 interest = interestFromDebt(debt);
            unchecked {
                // Cannot overflow due to max supply limits for both tokens
                totalDebt += debt;
                totalInterest += interest;
                totalCollateral += collateral;
                // There will not exist more than 2**256 loans
                ++i;
            }
```
If coolers_[i] is not corresponding correctly with loans_[i]) due to error in ordering arrays there may be problems such as reverts, incorrect claims, etc 

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to use a Struct instead as this reduces the chances of errors in ordering as each struct contains the details within it of the address of a cooler  and  correct loanId, and it makes it easier to check rather than checking two different arrays. 
```solidity
Struct Batch {
     address cooler;
     uint256 loanId;
}
// Use the struct instead in claimDefaulted function so each value 
function claimDefaulted(Batch[] defaulteds_) external {
 .....defaulteds_.address // use this
......defaulteds_.loadId // use this with above address from same struct limiting chances of ordering errors 
}
```
