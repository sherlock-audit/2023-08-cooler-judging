# Lender can lose funds after lending debt token
## Summary
Borrower can request a loan for particular amount of time and debt tokens he wants to borrow also collateral is added in advance. Therefore the borrower has time to repay the borrowed debt before the loan expires, or a lender defaults the loan and gets borrower's collateral

## Vulnerability Detail
One of the new features implemented is the manual claiming of accrued debt for a lender.

```solidity
 /// @notice Claim debt tokens if repayDirect was false.
    /// @param  loanID_ index of loan in loans[].
    function claimRepaid(uint256 loanID_) external {
        Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];

        // Update storage.
        uint256 claim = loan.unclaimed;
        delete loans[loanID_].unclaimed;

        // Transfer repaid debt back to the lender.
        debt().safeTransfer(loan.lender, claim);
    }
```

Thus when `repayDirect` is set to false then whenever a borrower repays a loan, debt will be added to `loan.unclaimed`

```solidity
 // Check whether repayment needs to be manually claimed or not.
        if (loan.repayDirect) {
            repayTo = loan.lender;
        } else {
            repayTo = address(this);
            loan.unclaimed += repaid_;
        }
```

Malicious borrower can cause loss of funds for the lender. **Scenario**:

1. Lender has set repayDirect to false so he can manually pick up his accrued debt.
2. He lends some debt tokens to a borrower.
3. Malicious borrower waits for the `block.timestamp` to reach near the `loan.expiry` in order to repay loan last second before it expires.
4. Now since the loan is repaid the debt tokens which the borrower had to return to the lender are added into the `loan.unclaimed` for this particular `loanID`

Thus the lender has to claim his debt by calling `claimRepaid()`
 
 ```solidity
 /// @notice Claim debt tokens if repayDirect was false.
    /// @param  loanID_ index of loan in loans[].
    function claimRepaid(uint256 loanID_) external {
        Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];

        // Update storage.
        uint256 claim = loan.unclaimed;
        delete loans[loanID_].unclaimed;

        // Transfer repaid debt back to the lender.
        debt().safeTransfer(loan.lender, claim);
    }

```

6. Now since the loan is expired and everything is paid back, malicious borrower can call `claimDefaulted()` BEFORE the lender claims his debt with `claimRepaid()` and delete this particular `loanID` without the lender being able to claim his debt.
```solidity

function claimDefaulted(uint256 loanID_) external returns (uint256, uint256, uint256) {
        Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];
        
        delete loans[loanID_];

        if (block.timestamp <= loan.expiry) revert NoDefault();

        // Transfer defaulted collateral to the lender. 
        //@audit nothing will be transferred since the borrower has paid back the loan                                                                                    
        collateral().safeTransfer(loan.lender, loan.collateral);

        // Log the event.
        factory().newEvent(loanID_, CoolerFactory.Events.DefaultLoan, 0);

        // If necessary, trigger lender callback.
        if (loan.callback) CoolerCallback(loan.lender).onDefault(loanID_, loan.amount, loan.collateral);
        return (loan.amount, loan.collateral, block.timestamp - loan.expiry);
    }

```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Since you have added a option for a lender to be able to claim his debt manually, make sure before defaulting and deleting a loan to check if there is any amount left in the `loan.unclaimed`.
