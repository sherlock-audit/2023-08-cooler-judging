# approve() function is vulnerable and malicious
## Summary
the approve function can be attacked

## Vulnerability Detail
Reentrancy Attacks - The usage of approve() in combination with the transferFrom() function can potentially introduce a reentrancy vulnerability. In a reentrancy attack, a malicious contract can repeatedly call transferFrom() within a single transaction, draining the victim's funds

Misuse of the function - The approve() function can be misused if not used properly. For instance, a contract might wrongly call the approve() function to approve itself to spend tokens, which is not necessary

Over-approval - If the user doesn't keep track of the amount they have approved for a specific spender, they could end up approving a larger amount than they intended. This could allow the spender to withdraw more tokens than the user meant to allow

Race Condition - The approve() function is susceptible to a race condition in a multi-transaction scenario. The race condition can occur when a user wants to change the approved amount for a spender. If the user first calls the approve() function to set the approved amount to 0, and then calls it again to set the new amount, there's a risk that the spender could spend the original amount before the first approve() transaction is mined. This could result in the spender spending more than the user intended
