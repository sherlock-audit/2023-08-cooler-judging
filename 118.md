# allowing the transfer of ownership of the loans , which the callback is activated , to an EOA (externally owned account) will force the loan become default
## severity 
high 
## Summary
if the lender transfer the ownership of his loan , that has an activated callback , to an externally owned account , will force the loan become default and if the borrower try to repay the loan it will revert and this cause a loss of funds for the borrower which will loss his collateral .    
## Vulnerability Detail
the cooler contract allow the lender to transfer the ownership of his loan to another lender by two step mechanism (approve , and transfer)  , by the function `approveTransfer()` and the function `transferOwnership()` . 
there are no checks that make sure that the new lender has a callback function or not , or the new lender is contract or EAO (externally owned account) 
the lender can accept the loan and activate the callback by passing `true` to the function `clearRequest()`

and if this lender is malicious and want to force this loan become defaulted after the value of the collateral increased , he can just transfer the ownership of the loan to EOA , this will prevent the borrower from repaying the debt by calling the `repayLoan()` function because the function will try to execute the callback `onRepay` on the EAO which will always revert .

## Impact
this vulnerability will lead to loss of fund for the borrower , who will never be able to get his collateral back after the ownership transfer to the EAO , and the lender will force the loan become default and get the collateral .

## Tool used

Manual Review , Vscode 

## Recommendation

add some checks in the function `approveTransfer()` to make sure if the callback is activated , the new lender **should not be an EAO and the function can make sure of that by checking the creation code of the address** , and if the new lender is contract this function ***should make sure that he implement the `onRepay` callback function**.
