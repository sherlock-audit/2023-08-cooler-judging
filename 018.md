# When borrower rolls their loan the lender can frontrun the transaction and change the interest and duration to drain all of borrower's approved tokens
## Summary

Lender can change their rolled loan conditions when a borrower calls `rollLoan()` by frontrunning with a `provideNewTermsForRoll()` with different loan conditions

## Vulnerability Detail

- The lender can set an initial fair loan offer through `provideNewTermsForRoll()`
- When the borrower calls `roll(-insert loanID)` with their loanID, the lender can frontrun this transaction by calling `provideNewTermsForRoll()` with different values of `interest`, `loanToCollateral` and `duration`:

```solidity
function provideNewTermsForRoll(
        uint256 loanID_,
        uint256 interest_,
        uint256 loanToCollateral_,
        uint256 duration_
    ) 
```

- The rollLoan() won't revert because the transaction will succeed as long as the loanID is valid, no matter what the interest, loanToCollateral and Duration parameters are set to.

There are at least 2 exploit paths (can be combined):
- The lender can increase interest and LoanToCollateral such that user calling `rollLoan()` has to send all their approved collateral tokens to the contract
- They lender can set duration to 1 so that the loan immediately defaults

## Impact
- Loan Roller gets unfair terms for roll
- Lender can steal all of Roller's approved collateral tokens
- Lender can make Roller's loan default in 1 second or block.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Some options:

Add interest, loanToCollateral and Duration parameters to the Roll function, and revert if they do not match the expected values.

or 

Add a timelock to `provideNewTermsForRoll` so that that the lender cannot change the loan request.
