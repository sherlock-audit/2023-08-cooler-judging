# Borrower can steal collateral without repaying the loan
## Summary
Borrower can use rescindRequest to steal the collateral and debt tokens while the lender is trying to set new terms for the loan.

## Vulnerability Detail
After ```provideNewTermsForRoll``` is called, request status is set to active(required before calling rollLoan) but there is already debt and collateral. The borrower can place a ```rescindRequest``` txn such that it is after ```provideNewTermsForRoll``` txn but before the rollLoan txn called by anyone. This way the borrower successfully withdraws his collateral through ```rescindRequest``` and the request status is again set to false resulting in the rollLoan reverting. The borrower now has the collateral as well as debt tokens and the lender loses all his debt tokens. 

## Impact
The lender loses all his debt tokens to the borrower and doesn't get any collateral back.
