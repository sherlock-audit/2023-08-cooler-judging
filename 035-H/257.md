# Lack of access control to `claimRepaid` and `claimDefaulted`
## Summary
Methods `claimRepaid` and `claimDefaulted` lack access control 

## Vulnerability Detail
Both methods `claimRepaid` and `claimDefaulted ` can be called by anyone. While not only it is an inconvenience, it can also result into loss of funds as `claimDefaulted` deletes the loan struct and any `unclaimed` value will be deleted (check my other issue) 
```solidity
    function claimDefaulted(uint256 loanID_) external returns (uint256, uint256, uint256) {
        Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];
        delete loans[loanID_];

        if (block.timestamp <= loan.expiry) revert NoDefault();

        // Transfer defaulted collateral to the lender.
        collateral().safeTransfer(loan.lender, loan.collateral);

        // Log the event.
        factory().newEvent(loanID_, CoolerFactory.Events.DefaultLoan, 0);

        // If necessary, trigger lender callback.
        if (loan.callback) CoolerCallback(loan.lender).onDefault(loanID_, loan.amount, loan.collateral);
        return (loan.amount, loan.collateral, block.timestamp - loan.expiry);
    }
```
