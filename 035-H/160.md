# If a loan defaults, the lender may lose the unclaimed amount.
## Summary
claimDefaulted removes the loan, causing the loss of any unclaimed amount that was saved in the loan and preventing the lender from claiming it.
## Vulnerability Detail
The claimRepaid function transfers unclaimed loans to the lender, while claimDefaulted deletes the loan (```delete loans[loanID_];```). If the lender has any unclaimed amount, it will be lost.
## Impact
Lender asset loss.
