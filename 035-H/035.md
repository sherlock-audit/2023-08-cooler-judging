# Lender Loses Collateral from Paritailly Repaid Loans that are Defaulted if repayDirect == true
## Summary

If the contract is set to a state where:

- borrower partially repaid
- the loan defaults
- repayDirect is false

Then the tokens the borrower previously repaid are not given to the lender.

This is because the `loan` is deleted (all variables set to zero) during `claimDefault`, and  the `loan.unclaimed` which tracked the partial repayment is unaccounted for. 

## Vulnerability Details

1. A borrower takes a loan, `loan.repayDirect` is set to `false`
2. The borrower repays their loan _partially_ . This means they call `repayLoan()` with the `loanID` and set `repaid` to less than the loan amount. The `loan.amount` and `loan.collateral` is decreased the calculation from the repaid amount:

```solidity
       loan.amount -= repaid_;
        //reduce collatereal amount
       loan.collateral -= decollateralized;
```

4. repayDirect is `false` so the logic in the else loop here is executed. 

```solidity
if (loan.repayDirect) {
            repayTo = loan.lender;
        } else {
            //otherwise repay to this address
            repayTo = address(this);
            //then add the repaid to unclaimed
            loan.unclaimed += repaid_;
        }
```

5.. This means that `loan.unclaimed` is increased by the repaid amount. The repaid amount is not sent to the lender. Instead, the information of the repayment is stored in the Loan struct.
6. The loan defaults
7.. Lender calls `claimDefaulted`. This immediately deletes the loan struct where the `loan.unclaimed` information was stored!

```solidity
function claimDefaulted(uint256 loanID_) external returns (uint256, uint256, uint256) {
        Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];
        delete loans[loanID_];
```

8. The lender gets paid only the `loan.collateral`, which was reduced during the repay loan step, `loan.amount -= repaid_;` and they get 0 tokens from `loan.unclaimed += repaid_;` because the loan was deleted without accounting for the unclaimed.

Result: Lender loses all the collateral which was paritially repaid by borrower before defaulting

## Impact

- The impact assuming no malicous intent is that lender loses all the collateral which was paritially repaid by borrower before defaulting
- However malicious borrowers could essentially sabotage all of a lenders collateral by waiting unitl their loan is about to default and pay back all the tokens except 1 token. This still counts as a partial repayment.
- Then, they could call `claimDefaulted()` with their loanID. The `claimDefaulted` has no access controls so they can call it even though they were the borrower. 
- Result: lender loses the whole collateral except 1 token

## Tool used

Manual review

## Recommendation

When the loan is defaulted, check the `loan.unclaimed` varaiable and store it. During the transfer add the `loan.unclaimed` to the collateral that is transferred back to the lender.
