# [H-03] Fee-on-transfer tokens can cause accounting error.
## Summary

Fee-on-transfer tokens such as USDT can cause accounting error and can also make the contract to be left with lower collateral tokens to send to borrower/ lender.

## Vulnerability Detail

In [Cooler.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol) we can use any ERC20 tokens as collateral and debt. But fee-on-transfer tokens such as USDT can cause accounting errors while calling [Cooler: :requestLoan()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/6d34cd12a2a15d2c92307d44782d6eae1474ab25/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol#L98C4-L125C6) and make the contract unable to have balances to transfer collateral back to user or even worse, transfer less collateral tokens to lender in case of default.

1. Alice deposits 100 USDT to Cooler but after fee only 90 (if fee is 10%) is added to the contract.
2. The contract accounts for 100 USDT and give that much borrowing power to Alice.
3. Bob lends debt token to Alice on the basis of `loanToAmount` ratio, but notice that it is calculated by Amount = 100, while the contract only holding 90 tokens.
4. The loan defaults and now the contract can't transfer the 100 USDT to Bob. 

## Impact

Accounting errors can cause loss for User.

## Code Snippet

```javascript
//File : :Cooler.sol

//Cooler: :requestLoan()

           collateral().safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender, //@audit-issue should be from owner().//check msg.sender == owner
            address(this),
            collateralFor(amount_, loanToCollateral_)
        );


// Cooler: :claimDefaulted()

        // Transfer defaulted collateral to the lender.
        collateral().safeTransfer(loan.lender, loan.collateral);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Factor in the fees that is incurred during transfer while accounting.
```diff
//Cooler: :requestLoan()

+  uint256 fee =CalculateFee(collateral(), amount);
requests.push(
            Request({
-              amount: amount_,
+              amount: amount_ - fee,
                interest: interest_,
                loanToCollateral: loanToCollateral_,
                duration: duration_,
                active: true
            }) 
        );

```
