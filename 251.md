# `RollLoan` event emitting is missing during `rollLoan()` function execution of `Cooler.sol`.
## Summary

`RollLoan` event emitting is missing during `rollLoan()` function execution of `Cooler.sol`. While in other functions of `Cooler.sol`, to emit relevant events `newEvent()` function of `CoolerFactory.sol` is called but in `rollLoan` function of `Cooler.sol`  `RollLoan` event emitting is missing.

## Vulnerability Detail

`RollLoan` event is defined inside `CoolerFactory.sol` to be emitted when loan is rolled using `rollLoan()` function. But it is never emitted in rollLoan() function which may cause unintended behaviour on frontend where code is expecting to emit this event but it will never emit.

## Impact

It may break flow on frontend or  wherever event listener (eg: The Graph) code is expecting  event `RollLoan` to be emitted after calling `rollLoan()` and may cause unintended behaviour.  

## Code Snippet

```solidity
File: Cooler/src/Cooler.sol

208:       // Save updated loan info in storage.
             loans[loanID_] = loan;

              if (newCollateral > 0) {
                 collateral().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newCollateral);
              }

               // If necessary, trigger lender callback.
216:        if (loan.callback) CoolerCallback(loan.lender).onRoll(loanID_, newDebt, newCollateral);

## Tool Used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Call `newEvent()` function of `CoolerFactory.sol`   in `rollLoan()` function of `Cooler.sol` to emit `RollLoan` event whenever loan is successfully rolled.

```diff
File: Cooler/src/Cooler.sol 

208:    // Save updated loan info in storage.
        loans[loanID_] = loan;

        if (newCollateral > 0) {
            collateral().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newCollateral);
        }
+        // Log the event.
+        factory().newEvent(loanID_, CoolerFactory.Events.RollLoan, 0);

        // If necessary, trigger lender callback.
216:        if (loan.callback) CoolerCallback(loan.lender).onRoll(loanID_, newDebt, newCollateral);
```
