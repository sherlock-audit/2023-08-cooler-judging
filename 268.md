# precision loss in calculating interest
## Summary

`Cooler.interestFor()` calculate interest based on interest rate and duration of borrow request which has precision loss

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
   function interestFor(uint256 amount_, uint256 rate_, uint256 duration_) public pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 interest = (rate_ * duration_) / 365 days;
        return (amount_ * interest) / DECIMALS_INTEREST;
    }
```

current implementation works on round result to divdown , which is unprofitable to lenders .
As lenders are providing deposits so it should be in the favor of lenders.
Also div first and multiplication is not a good implemenation.
first interest calculation should be 

```solidity
   function interestFor(uint256 amount_, uint256 rate_, uint256 duration_) public pure returns (uint256) {
        return (amount_ * rate_* duration_) / (365* DECIMALS_INTEREST);
    }
```
and possibly roundup by openzeppelin's math library 

## Impact

A little precision loss and Calculated interest is round down in favor of  borrower but it should be in favor of lender

## Code Snippet

see above 

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Already given in Vulnerability details and round up interest to favor lender who is providing funds to borrower
