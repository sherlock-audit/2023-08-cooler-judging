# reorg attack due to usage of clone
## Summary
An attacker can steal funds via a reorg attack if a contract is funded within a few blocks of being created inside a factory.

## Vulnerability Detail
Re-orgs can happen in all EVM chains. In ethereum, where currently Cooler is deployed, it is not "super common" but it still happens.

The issue would happen when users rely on the address derivation in advance or try to deploy the position clone with the same address on different EVM chains, any funds sent to the new clone could potentially be withdrawn by anyone else. All in all, it could lead to the theft of user funds.

due to low probability i'm marking this as Medium

## Impact
Funds could be loss

## Code Snippet
```solidity
            cooler = address(coolerImplementation).clone(coolerData); //@audit clone deterministic
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
use `cloneDeterministic` as `cloneDeterministic` uses the opcode and a salt to deterministically deploy the clone. Using the same implementation and salt multiple times will revert since the clones cannot be deployed twice at the same address.
