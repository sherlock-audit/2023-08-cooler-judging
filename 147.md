# Lender can roll loan with arbitrary terms
## Summary
Lender can provideNewTermsForRoll and then rollLoan with these terms because it permissionless. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Basicly it allow lender to arbitrary set interest, LTC and duration - increase debt as he wants. This may require to pledge additional collateral (or may not if decrease LTC), but if debt increase is huge, borrower won't repay and anyway lose collateral. 
Attack path: 
1. lender clears loan
2. calls provideNewTermsForRoll with huge interest rate to drascticly increase debt, small duration and smaller ltc to not provide additional collateral
3. calls rollLoan
4. now borrowers forced to lose collateral or pay huge debt

## Impact
Lender arbitrary increase loan debt. Borrower lose collateral if don't repay.
