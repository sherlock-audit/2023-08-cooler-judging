# Lender can force defaulting of a loan without the borrower's permission
## Summary
There is an option for the lender to set repayDirect to true if he wants to get paid the loan amount directly. But he can set the lender address to a blacklisted address and the borrower will never be able to repay the loan, leading to forced default. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The same issue was found in the first sherlock audit [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler-chinmay-farkya/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=audit-item.md&title=) and there has been an attempt to fix it, but it is still not resolved. 

If a lender wants the borrower's collateral forcefully, he can set the ```repayDirect``` to true via ```setRepay``` function and then call ```transferOwnership``` to change lender address to one that is blacklisted by the debt ERC20 token (ex. USDC/USDT) and is controlled by him. Any calls to ```repayLoan``` will thus revert and then he will wait for the loan to default. After loan expiry, he can call ```claimDefaulted``` to claim the collateral.

## Impact
The borrower will lose all pending collateral and can even lose whole of his collateral unnecessarily.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either include the repayDirect immutable value in the loan request information so that both parties can agree on the process, or require the borrower's approval while changing the lender address so that he can verify.
