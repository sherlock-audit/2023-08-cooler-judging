# when the transaction was fail the transfer con't revert because can't checked.
## Summary
The ERC20 token specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) defined the required interface of an ERC20 token. This included defining the functions transfer, transferFrom, and approve such that they return a bool signalling whether the function was successful or not. The specification goes on to say that functions should throw on failure, however throwing is not a requirement. This specification has lead to the development of 3 different types of ERC20 tokens:

1.Tokens that throw on failure, and return true on success. One example is DAI.
2.Tokens that return false on failure, and return true on success. One example is ZRX.
3.Tokens that throw on failure, and do not return a boolean. One example is USDT.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
when the transfer will fail they con't revert.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
check that value that transfer is success or not.

ex.
 (bool success) =gOHM.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), collateral);
require (success,"transaction fail");
