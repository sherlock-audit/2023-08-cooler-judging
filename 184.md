# Lender force Loan become default
## Summary
This vulnerability pertains to the repayLoan function, which allows a lender to potentially force a loan into default due to a transfer failure when repaying the debt when the lender sets repayDirect to true. The transfer failure occurs because the lender's address might be unable to accept the debt token, leading to a revert and eventual loan default.

## Vulnerability Detail
The repayLoan function, responsible for repaying loans, has a critical flaw that could result in unintended loan defaults. 
If the lender sets repayDirect to true ,the only way for the borrower to get the collateral token back is to repay the amount owed via repayLoan(). Currently in the repayLoan() method transfers the debt token directly to the Lender if repayDirect s set to true by the lender . This has a problem: if the Lender is blacklisted by the debt token now, the debtToken.transferFrom() method will fail and the repay() method will always fail and finally the Loan will default. 

## Impact
Lender forced Loan become default for get collateral token, owner lost collateral token

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol#L151

       function repayLoan(uint256 loanID_, uint256 repaid_) external returns (uint256) {
        Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];

        if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) revert Default();
	..
         if (loan.repayDirect) {
         repayTo = loan.lender;
       }
      ...
        // Transfer repaid debt back to the lender and (de)collateral back to the owner.
        debt().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, repayTo, repaid_);
        collateral().safeTransfer(owner(), decollateralized);
        ..
        }

## Recommendation
implement only the indirect repay method
