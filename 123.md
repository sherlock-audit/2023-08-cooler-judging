# Hardcoded LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL in ClearingHouse allows undercollateralised loans to occur.
## Summary
LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL is initialised to a value greater than the current price of gOHM allowing users to take out undercollateralized loans.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user utilises ClearingHouse to take out a loan of DAI the amount of collateral they need to post is determined by the variable 
LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL. It is currently set to a value greater than the value of gOHM (currently $2,901.79 at time of report as per [coinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/governance-ohm)) allowing users to take undercollateralized loans.

i.e. Bob creates a cooler than calls lendToCooler with amount 3,000. 
The amount of collateral he needs to send to receive 3,000 DAI is calculated using cooler.collateralFor():
```Solidity
collateral = (amount_ * (10 ** collateral().decimals())) / loanToCollateral_;
                = 3,000e18 * 1e18 / 3,000e18
                = 1e18 or 1 gOHM
```
As the current price of gOHM is $2,901.79 he take out a loan of 3,000 DAI and make a profit of $98.21 with no intention of ever paying back the loan. This could be repeated as long as gOHM's value remains below $3,000.

## Impact
Users can issue many undercollateralized loans draining DAI from the protocol.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either utilise an oracle to fetch the price or if the protocol does not wish to do that change LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL from a constant so it's value can be modified if the price of gOHM drops. It should also have it's initial value changed to lower than the current value of gOHM i.e. change to something like 2,500e18. However this is still vulnerable if the price of gOHM drops rapidly and LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL is not updated immediately.
