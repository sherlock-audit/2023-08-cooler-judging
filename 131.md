Clumsy Malachite Cow

# Grief Attack
## Summary
Unbounded Loop can cause a possible griefing attack

## Vulnerability Detail
Since this function implementation has no roles, malicious users can set a gasLimit or input large amounts of loans in a loan array to cause the loans loop to revert before the end of the loop, which will prevent everything below the loop from not working. On revert, everything is reversed except the external called function from the cooler which will cause a discrepancy in the record-keeping by treasury and tokens transactions.

While this can be done anywhere it is easier to be done in functions containing unbounded loops and updates after the looping
## Impact
Inconsistent record keeping that could lead to loss of funds
## Code Snippet

```solidity
function claimDefaulted(address[] calldata coolers_, uint256[] calldata loans_) external {
        uint256 loans = loans_.length;
        if (loans != coolers_.length) revert LengthDiscrepancy();

        uint256 totalDebt;
        uint256 totalInterest;
        uint256 totalCollateral;
        uint256 keeperRewards;
        for (uint256 i=0; i < loans;) {
            // Validate that cooler was deployed by the trusted factory.
            if (!factory.created(coolers_[i])) revert OnlyFromFactory();
            
            // Claim defaults and update cached metrics.
            (uint256 debt, uint256 collateral, uint256 elapsed) = Cooler(coolers_[i]).claimDefaulted(loans_[i]);
            uint256 interest = interestFromDebt(debt);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There are two possible good solutions:
- Enforce a minimum number of gas to be used
- Enforce the max length of a loan
