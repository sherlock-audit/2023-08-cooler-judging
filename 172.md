# Exchange rate for DAI/gOHM may be inaccurate
## Summary

The DAI/gOHM exchange rate is stored in `LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL` constant variable. Since it is hardcoded, it is obvious that sooner or later it will become inaccurate.

## Vulnerability Detail

When you create a new loan, `ClearingHouse.sol` passes `LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL`, this value is used for conversion calculations. If the price of gOHM goes down or up, the calculations will not be accurate, as it is already $2900 at the time of writing.

PoC #2 

If call lendToCooler() with 2900DAI, the collateral amount will be 966,666,666,666,666,666 = 0.96 gOHM 

- when it should be 1 ****(based on the current price), then `receivables` will be 2,904,806,849,315,068,489,796.

```solidity
function debtForCollateral(uint256 collateral_) public pure returns (uint256) {
    // DURATION = 10,454,400
    // 365 days = 31,536,000
    uint256 interestPercent = (INTEREST_RATE * DURATION) / 365 days; // 1,657,534,246,575,342
    uint256 loan = collateral_ * LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL / 1e18; // 2,899,999,999,999,999,998,000
    uint256 interest = loan * interestPercent / 1e18; // 4,806,849,315,068,491,796
    return loan + interest; // 2,899,999,999,999,999,998,000 + 4,806,849,315,068,491,796 = 2,904,806,849,315,068,489,796
}
```

But inside the `clearRequest()` the actual amount of the loan is 2,904,806,849,315,068,491,800 (2004 more than `receivables`), because the interest is calculated based on the DAI amount requested, not as in the `ClearingHouse` based on the loan amount, converted from collateral. The value of the `receivables` isnâ€™t the same as the loan amount.

## Impact

The user will get a loan at one price, put up their collateral, and when the price of gOHM falls, they will use the loan amount to buy gOHM at a lower price and profit from the difference.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
// Cooler/src/ClearingHouse.sol

55:@>uint256 public constant LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL = 3000e18;       // 3,000 DAI/gOHM
```

The `LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL` is used to start a loan, and for all the conversions between debt and collateral tokens.

```solidity
function lendToCooler(Cooler cooler_, uint256 amount_) external returns (uint256) {
    // Attempt a clearinghouse <> treasury rebalance.
    rebalance();
    // Validate that cooler was deployed by the trusted factory.
    if (!factory.created(address(cooler_))) revert OnlyFromFactory();
    // Validate cooler collateral and debt tokens.
    if (cooler_.collateral() != gOHM || cooler_.debt() != dai) revert BadEscrow();

    // Compute and access collateral. Increment loan receivables.
    uint256 collateral = cooler_.collateralFor(amount_, LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL);
    // @audit why sum up this 2,904,806,849,315,068,489,796
    receivables += debtForCollateral(collateral);
    gOHM.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), collateral);

    // Create a new loan request.
    gOHM.approve(address(cooler_), collateral);
    uint256 reqID = cooler_.requestLoan(amount_, INTEREST_RATE, LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL, DURATION);

    // Clear the created loan request by providing enough DAI.
    sdai.withdraw(amount_, address(this), address(this));
    dai.approve(address(cooler_), amount_);
    uint256 loanID = cooler_.clearRequest(reqID, true, true);
    
    return loanID;
}
