# `claimRepaid()` doesn’t check for msg.sender
## Summary

`claimRepaid()` need a check for `msg.sender`, so that only he can decide when to get his claim.

## Vulnerability Detail

If the lender does not want to receive the repaid value when the borrower repays, but to receive it at the end, now it isn’t possible, because the current implementation allows anyone to execute it and the lender will receive their unclaimed DAI.

## Impact

Anyone can call this function and it will send the lender their unclaimed DAI.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function claimRepaid(uint256 loanID_) external {
    Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];

    // Update storage.
    uint256 claim = loan.unclaimed;
    delete loans[loanID_].unclaimed;

    // Transfer repaid debt back to the lender.
    debt().safeTransfer(loan.lender, claim);
}
```
