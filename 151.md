# Malicious user can mint debt to `TRSRYv1`
## Summary
Malicious user can `requestLoan()` and `clearRequest()` against himself. This will increase the TRSRYv1 debt which will have to be paid back at some point (out of the scope). User can mint debt to the protocol by supplying gas fee. 
## Vulnerability Detail
User is able to `requestLoan` with any input parameter as long as someone else is willing to fulfill the request. Therefore, `duration` can be set to as little as 0 (flash loan attack is also a viable route).
```solidity
function requestLoan(
        uint256 amount_,
        uint256 interest_,
        uint256 loanToCollateral_,
        uint256 duration_
    ) external returns (uint256 reqID)
```
The same user will immediately call `clearRequest()` as the protocol does not prevent users from borrowing against themselves. The loan will default almost instantly. And the protocol rewards users who call `claimDefaulted()` on `Clearinghouse.sol`.
```solidity
for (uint256 i=0; i < loans;) {
            // Validate that cooler was deployed by the trusted factory.
            if (!factory.created(coolers_[i])) revert OnlyFromFactory();
            
            // Claim defaults and update cached metrics.
            (uint256 debt, uint256 collateral, uint256 elapsed) = Cooler(coolers_[i]).claimDefaulted(loans_[i]);
            uint256 interest = interestFromDebt(debt);
            unchecked {
                // Cannot overflow due to max supply limits for both tokens
                totalDebt += debt;
                totalInterest += interest;
                totalCollateral += collateral;
                // There will not exist more than 2**256 loans
                ++i;
            }

            // Cap rewards to 5% of the collateral to avoid OHM holder's dillution.
            uint256 maxAuctionReward = collateral * 5e16 / 1e18;
            // Cap rewards to avoid exorbitant amounts.
            uint256 maxReward = (maxAuctionReward < MAX_REWARD)
                ? maxAuctionReward
                : MAX_REWARD;
            // Calculate rewards based on the elapsed time since default.
            keeperRewards = (elapsed < 7 days)
                ? keeperRewards + maxReward * elapsed / 7 days
                : keeperRewards + maxReward;
        }

        // Decrement loan receivables.
        receivables = (receivables > totalDebt) ? receivables - totalDebt : 0;
        // Update outstanding debt owed to the Treasury upon default.
        uint256 outstandingDebt = TRSRY.reserveDebt(dai, address(this));
        // debt owed to TRSRY = user debt - user interest
        TRSRY.setDebt({
            debtor_: address(this),
            token_: dai,
            amount_: (outstandingDebt > (totalDebt - totalInterest))
                ? outstandingDebt - (totalDebt - totalInterest)
                : 0
        });

        // Reward keeper.
        gOHM.transfer(msg.sender, keeperRewards);
        // Unstake and burn the collateral of the defaulted loans.
        gOHM.approve(address(staking), totalCollateral - keeperRewards);
        MINTR.burnOhm(address(this), staking.unstake(address(this), totalCollateral - keeperRewards, false, false));
```
The caller will receive some gOHM tokens and TRSRY debt will increase. Borrower/Lender does not lose anything in this case, only some gas fee. 
## Impact
Increased debt in TRSRYv1

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Prevent users from borrowing against themselves.
```solidity
    function clearRequest(
        uint256 reqID_,
        bool repayDirect_,
        bool isCallback_
    ) external returns (uint256 loanID) {
+       if(msg.sender == owner()) revert();
        Request memory req = requests[reqID_];

        // If necessary, ensure lender implements the CoolerCallback abstract.
        if (isCallback_ && !CoolerCallback(msg.sender).isCoolerCallback()) revert NotCoolerCallback();

        // Ensure loan request is active. 
        if (!req.active) revert Deactivated();

        // Clear the loan request in memory.
        req.active = false;

        // Calculate and store loan terms.
        uint256 interest = interestFor(req.amount, req.interest, req.duration);
        uint256 collat = collateralFor(req.amount, req.loanToCollateral);
        uint256 expiration = block.timestamp + req.duration;
        loanID = loans.length;
        loans.push(
            Loan({
                request: req,
                amount: req.amount + interest,
                unclaimed: 0,
                collateral: collat,
                expiry: expiration,
                lender: msg.sender,
                repayDirect: repayDirect_,
                callback: isCallback_
            })
        );

        // Clear the loan request storage.
        requests[reqID_].active = false;

        // Transfer debt tokens to the owner of the request.
        debt().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, owner(), req.amount);

        // Log the event.
        factory().newEvent(reqID_, CoolerFactory.Events.ClearRequest, 0);
    }
```
