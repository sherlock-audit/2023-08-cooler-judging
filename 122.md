# the lender can force the loan become defaulted by prevent the borrower from repaying the debt .
## severity 
high

## Summary
if the lender get blacklisted by the debt token after accepting the loan or the lender transfer the ownership of the loan to an address that is blacklisted by the debt token , this will prevent the borrower from taking his collateral back and the malicious lender will get the collateral . 

## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens (e.g. USDC, USDT) have a contract level admin controlled address blocklist. If an address is blocked, then transfers to and from that address are forbidden.
if the protocol try to send the tokens to a blacklisted address the function will always revert .
there are 2 scenarios of this vulnerability : 
1) after the lender accept the loan request and send the debt tokens to the borrower , the lender can get blacklisted by the debt token , so this will lead to the prevent the borrower from repaying the loan and take his collateral , because the function repay send the debt token back to the lender as shown here :

2) if the lender transfer the ownership to an address that is blacklisted by the debt token , so as the first scenario ,the borrower will be prevented from repaying the loan and get his collateral back .  
## Impact
this vulnerability will lead to loss of funds for the borrower how will not be able to get his collateral back .

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a withdrawal pattern ("pull over push") instead of directly send the tokens to the lender . See: https://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/pull_over_push.html for details. This way the function `repayLoan()` will not revert .
by adding a function `withdraw` to allow the `lender` to withdraw his debt tokens , and creating a storage variable to store the balance of the lender , or the protocol can prevent the direct repayments and use the function `claimRepaid()`  as default .

```solidity
uint256 public balance ;  
function withdraw(uint256 amount) external {
    balance -= amount ;
    debt.safeTransfer(msg.sender , amount); 
   }
```
