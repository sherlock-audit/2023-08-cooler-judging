# Contract owner can call `rescindRequest` on other requests and steal their collateral.
## Summary
Contract owner can call `rescindRequest` on other requests and steal their collateral.

## Vulnerability Detail
Upon creating a borrow request, users deposit their collateral in the `Cooler.sol` contract. In case they want to cancel the request, a call to `rescindRequest` must be made. However, the problem is that upon calling `rescindRequest` it automatically sends the collateral to the Contract owner 
```solidity
    function rescindRequest(uint256 reqID_) external {
        if (msg.sender != owner()) revert OnlyApproved();

        Request storage req = requests[reqID_];

        if (!req.active) revert Deactivated();

        // Update storage and send collateral back to the owner.
        req.active = false;
        collateral().safeTransfer(owner(), collateralFor(req.amount, req.loanToCollateral));  // @audit - transfers to owner 

        // Log the event.
        factory().newEvent(reqID_, CoolerFactory.Events.RescindRequest, 0);
    }
```
This way, upon every creation of a request, the contract owner can steal the collateral deposited by the users
## Impact
Owner can steal collateral
