# decimal doesn't work properly breaking the lending/borrowing at many places
## Summary

Decimal implementation in `Cooler.sol` doesn't work properly 

## Vulnerability Detail

whenever a borrower make a request for borrowing `amounts_` of dept tokens he need to transfer corresponding collateral token that depends on  `loanToCollateral_` [debt tokens per collateral token pledged]

Alice is a borrower and request `_amount` of USDC debt by giving DAI or (any token with 18 decimal )as collateral token `loanToCollateral_=50%` with some duration and interest rate.

Now to calculate collateral amount ` collateralFor` has been used

```solidity
    /// @notice Compute collateral needed for loan amount at given loan to collateral ratio.
    /// @param  amount_ of collateral tokens.
    /// @param  loanToCollateral_ ratio for loan.
    function collateralFor(uint256 amount_, uint256 loanToCollateral_) public view returns (uint256) {
        return (amount_ * (10 ** collateral().decimals())) / loanToCollateral_;
    }
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol#L368-L373C6

And for above Alice's request this `collateralFor` will return value very less than expected 
```solidity
amount_  (USDC)= some value * 10**6
collateral().decimals() is 18 
and loanToCollateral is also in 10**18

hence the end result will be 10**(6 +18)/ 10**18 a value of the order of 10**6  
[PS.   ignoring actual number of tokens here to give idea about order of final output) 

```
This value should be in the order of collateral token but this is in order of debt token
Further `requestLoan` tranfer this amount as collateral
```solidity
115        // The collateral is taken upfront. Will be escrowed
        // until the loan is repaid or defaulted.
        collateral().safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            collateralFor(amount_, loanToCollateral_)
121        );
        // Log the event.
        factory().newEvent(reqID, CoolerFactory.Events.RequestLoan, 0);

```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol#L115-L121

getting `newEvent`, A lender will see high ``loanToCollateral_=50%`` and fullfill the request in `clearRequest` function

```solidity
    function clearRequest(
        uint256 reqID_,
        bool repayDirect_,
        bool isCallback_
    ) external returns (uint256 loanID) {
        Request memory req = requests[reqID_];

       [.........................]

        // Calculate and store loan terms.
        uint256 interest = interestFor(req.amount, req.interest, req.duration);
        uint256 collat = collateralFor(req.amount, req.loanToCollateral); // @audit-issue doesn't calculate correct collateral for all tokens
        uint256 expiration = block.timestamp + req.duration;
        loanID = loans.length;
       [.......................]

        // Clear the loan request storage.
        requests[reqID_].active = false;

        // Transfer debt tokens to the owner of the request.
        debt().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, owner(), req.amount); //@audit-issue transferring requested amount while collateral is negligible

        // Log the event.
        factory().newEvent(reqID_, CoolerFactory.Events.ClearRequest, 0);
        );
```

Causing loss of funds of lender here.

Main cause of this issue is assuming all the tokens have 18 decimals but tokens such as USDC and many other doesn't have 18 decimals which will drain the lender funds in current implementation or borrowers will end up paying high collateral 

## Impact
Fund loss of Lender and Borrower might have to pay high collateral than expected

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

calculation of collateral token should include decimal of debt and collateral token to scale them into 18 decimals or collateral's decimal
