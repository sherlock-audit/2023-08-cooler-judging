# Should be able to reset callback setting in transferOwnership function
## Summary

Since the `callback` setting cannot be changed, the protocol will not work properly if the lender is changed by `transferOwnership`  ****to an contract that did not implement callback function or to the EOA.

## Vulnerability Detail

The lender can change the lender address in `transferOwnership`. If the lender is changed to a contract that does not inherit CoolerCallback or to EOA, the callback function will no longer work. If the `lender.callback` setting was `true`, the `repayLoan` , `rollLoan`, and `claimDefaulted` functions will fail until the lender address changed back to the contract that implements the callback.

## Impact

The protocol will not work normally. The borrower is unable to repay the debt, which prevents the lender from get token back.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add `callback` parameter to `transferOwnership` so that `callback` setting can be changed. Or add a set function to change `callback` settings.

```diff
+ function transferOwnership(uint256 loanID_, bool callback_) external {
    if (msg.sender != approvals[loanID_]) revert OnlyApproved();

    // Update the load lender.
    loans[loanID_].lender = msg.sender;
+   loans[loanID_].callback = callback_;

    // Clear transfer approvals.
    approvals[loanID_] = address(0);
}
```
