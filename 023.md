# LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL is hardcoded in Clearinghouse which would allow for undercollateralized loans when price of DAI or gOHM changes
## Summary
## Vulnerability Detail

LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL is set to 3000 DAI per OHM:

```solidity
    uint256 public constant LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL = 3000e18;       // 3,000 DAI/gOHM
```

This is close to the current conversion rate of DAI to OHM based off CoinMarketCap. However, the conversion rate between DAI and gOHM is constantly changing. If the price changes, this could lead to undercollatarlized loans. Users could take loans where the loan value exceeds the collateral, essentially draining value form the contract.

Since the LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL is hardcoded, this contract could be drained for as long as it has funds to loan out.


## Impact
- ClearingHouse can give out loans too cheaply
- DAI and gOHM loan ratio cannot ever change for a clearingHouse

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Have a function with restricted access which can update the Loan-to-collateral ratio
