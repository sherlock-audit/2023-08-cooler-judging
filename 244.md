# `Cooler.sol` allows zero amount / collateral borrow request
## Summary

`Cooler.sol` allows zero amount/zero collateral borrow request which will be never fulfilled by lenders

## Vulnerability Detail

An Attacker can scam with zero amounts or higher amount with zero collateral borrow request. Such request won't be filled by lenders and meaning.
```solidity
  function requestLoan(
        uint256 amount_,
        uint256 interest_,
        uint256 loanToCollateral_,
        uint256 duration_
    ) external returns (uint256 reqID) {
        reqID = requests.length;
        requests.push(
            Request({
                amount: amount_,
                interest: interest_,
                loanToCollateral: loanToCollateral_,
                duration: duration_,
                active: true
            })
        );

        // The collateral is taken upfront. Will be escrowed
        // until the loan is repaid or defaulted.
        collateral().safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            collateralFor(amount_, loanToCollateral_)
        );

        // Log the event.
        factory().newEvent(reqID, CoolerFactory.Events.RequestLoan, 0);
    }
```

`requestLoan` doesn't if borrower request can be practically filled or not.
As amount with 0 or `loanToCollateral_=0` will be never filled by lenders.
Attacker can use this to scam the orderbook by continuously making borrow request and between them valid orders can be stuck.

FLOW

Attacker started spamming with borrow request as just he has to pay tiny gas fees for doing this. 

inittal reqID= 100
Due to spamming current reqID 1000000  or more

between these suppose Alice request some valid request so due to spam request fulfillingher request will be very hard and she will have to withdraw her collateral.

Bigger impact can be DOS since multiple attackers can increase impact 

## Impact
  On bigger level DOS but in general valid request will go unseen for a long time 

## Code Snippet

see above

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Don't allow request which can't be filled practically or lenders will never fulfill such as  request with zero amount ,zero or 100% loanToCollateral . That will mitigate this issue as Attacker will be to transfer collateral token to contract for spamming
