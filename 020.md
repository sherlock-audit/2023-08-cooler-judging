# RollLoan can be called on someone else's loan giving them worse conditions or defaulting them in 1 block
## Summary

`rollLoan` can be called by any user even if they are not the borrower. A lender could set unfavorable loan conditions and then force the borrower to take them by calling `rollLoan()`. 

## Vulnerability Detail

- `rollLoan` can be called by any user
- Lender could set the duration by calling `function provideNewTermsForRoll(uint256 loanID_uint256 interest_uint256, , loanToCollateral_, 1)`
- In the above call, `_duration` is set to 1, meaning the loan will be almost immediately default if accepted. They can also change the loanToCollateral and interest.
- Lender calls `rollLoan`. Since the collateral does not increase, this is free.
- Lender gets to default the loan and take the collateral.

## Impact
- Roll loaner can be called on borrower without consent
- Lender can force loaner to accept unfair loan terms
- Lender can cause 1 second default of loan to gain unfair profit.
