# DAI/gOHM exchange rate may be diffrent
## Summary
The `LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL` variable is a constant which implies a specific DAI/gOHM echange rate. The exchange rate has already changed so the current value in use will be wrong, and any value chosen now will eventually be out of date.
## Vulnerability Detail
Hardcode (constant) price of gOHM is bad because if price is like now($2900) or bellow attacker can buy 10 gOHM for $29000  from uniswap and after that get loan from ClearingHouse for 30000 DAI and he can make 1000 profit. 
## Impact
Significant loss of funds for protocol.
## PoC
Result with rate 2000 DAI / 1 gOHM
`console::log(Balance DAI attacker: , 8303858915648172514660 [8.303e21]) [staticcall]`
Result with rate 3000 DAI / 1 gOHM
`console::log(Balance DAI attacker: , 6475684438439013400995655 [6.475e24]) [staticcall]`
