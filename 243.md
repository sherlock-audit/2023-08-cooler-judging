# Lender can front-run `rollLoan` and call `provideNewTermsForRoll` with unfavorable terms
## Summary
Lender can front-run `rollLoan` and result in borrower accepting unfavorable terms.

## Vulnerability Detail
After a loan is created, the lender can provide new loan terms via `provideNewTermsForRoll`. If they are reasonable, the user can then accept them. However this opens up a risky scenario: 
1. User A borrows from lender B 
2. Lender B proposes new suitable terms 
3. User A sees them and calls `rollLoan` to accept them
4. Lender B is waiting for this and sees the pending transaction in the mempool
5. Lender B front-runs user A's transaction and makes a new call to `provideNewTermsForRoll` will an extremely high interest rate
6. User A's transaction now executes and they've accepted unfavorable terms with extremely high interest rate

## Impact
User may get mislead in to accepting unfavorable terms and overpaying interest
