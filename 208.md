# A malicious user can delete a loan that `defaults` with `unclaimed`, causing the lender to lose the debt token.
## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

`claimDefaulted` is a function that reclaims the collateral of a loan when it defaults.

It can be called by anyone when a loan is in default and deletes the loans information with `delete loans[loanID_];`.

The information that is deleted includes `unclaimed`, which means that the borrower will not receive the unclaimed portion of the payment.

Since loans do not have the status of having been repaid, they may default over time even if the `borrower` has paid off the debt. In other words, if unclaimed contains all the debt that has been paid off, but it defaults without being claimed, any user can call `claimDefaulted` to prevent the debt from being received.  In this case, there is no collateral left, and the borrower loses all the debt tokens they lent.

## Impact
Borrower loses all the debt tokens they lent.

If unclaimed is present at `claimDefaulted`, `claimRepaid` should be called.
