# Solmate safeTransferLib.sol functions does not check the codesize of the token address, which may lead to fund loss
## Summary
Solmate safeTransferLib.sol functions does not check the codesize of the token address, which may lead to fund loss

## Vulnerability Detail
## Impact
In Cooler.sol contract, Most of the functions have used the safeTransfer() and safeTransferFrom() doesn't check the existence of code at the token address. This is a known issue while using solmate's libraries.

Per the Solmate safeTransferLib.sol,

> Note that none of the functions in this library check that a token has code at all! .....

Hence using [safeTransferLib.sol](https://github.com/ohmzeus/Cooler/blob/c6f2bbe1b51cdf3bb4d078875170177a1b8ba2a3/src/Cooler.sol#L4) library may lead to miscalculation of funds and may lead to loss of funds , because if safetransfer() and safetransferfrom() are called on a token address that doesn't have contract in it, it will always return success, bypassing the return value check. Due to this protocol will think that funds has been transferred and successful , and records will be accordingly calculated, but in reality funds were never transferred.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use openzeppelin's safeERC20 which takes care of token code existence.
