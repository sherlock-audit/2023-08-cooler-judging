# the lack of checks for the actual amount of tokens that the cooler contract received will cause a huge loss of funds for the lender and the borrower with some ERC20 tokens  .
## Summary
the actual amount to receive can be less than the amount sent with some ERC20 tokens called Fee-on-transfer tokens , this type of tokens will make the cooler contract insolvent and can cause loss of funds for the lenders who use indirect repayments . 
## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens take a transfer fee (e.g. STA, PAXG), some do not currently charge a fee but may do so in the future (e.g. USDT, USDC).

if the collateral token of the cooler is fee-on-transfer token this can cause a huge loss of funds for the lender and will force the loan become default , and will prevent the  lender from claim the default loans , because when the borrower send the collateral to the cooler the actual amount to be received is less than the amount specified by the borrower so when the borrower want to repay the loan and get the collateral back , the amount that will be sent to the borrower will be more than the actual balance of the cooler contract , this will make the cooler contract insolvent and the function will revert and will prevent the borrower from taking his collateral , and this also prevent the lender from claiming the defaulted loans , because when the lender call `claimDefaulted()` function to claim the default loan the function will revert because it will try to send amount of collateral tokens greater that the actual amount in the contract . 
 
this vulnerability also prevent the `owner` from rescind the request after he request a loan , because the contract will not be able to send amount collateral more that the amount the contract actually have .  
## Poc 
1) Alice use the token STA as the collateral to borrow DAI tokens , Alice specify amount 100 STA as `loan.collateral` and `loanToCollateral` equal to 1 and without interestRate `interest_ = 0` , so she can borrow 100 DAI . 
2) Alice called the function `requestLoan()` and sent the 100 tokens of STA, assume that the STA take 10% of the value transferred as fee   , the `loan.amount` will be equal to 100 , but the actual amount was send to the cooler contract is 90 STA . 
3) Bob has the 100 DAI and accept the loan request and call the function `clearRequest()` and send the tokens to Alice . 
4) before the duration of the loan ended Alice tried to repay the loan and get his 100 STA , but the function `repayLoan()` always reverted because this function tried to send the all 100 STA to Alice but the actual balance of the cooler of the STA tokens was 90 STA , so Alice was prevented from repaying the loan . 
```solidity
    function repayLoan(uint256 loanID_, uint256 repaid_) external returns (uint256) {
        Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];

        if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) revert Default();

        if (repaid_ > loan.amount) repaid_ = loan.amount;

        uint256 decollateralized = (loan.collateral * repaid_) / loan.amount;
        if (decollateralized == 0) revert ZeroCollateralReturned();

        // Update loan memory.
        loan.amount -= repaid_;
        loan.collateral -= decollateralized;

        address repayTo;
        // Check whether repayment needs to be manually claimed or not.
        if (loan.repayDirect) {
            repayTo = loan.lender;
        } else {
            repayTo = address(this);
            loan.unclaimed += repaid_;
        }

        // Save updated loan info in storage.
        loans[loanID_] = loan;

        // Transfer repaid debt back to the lender and (de)collateral back to the owner.
        debt().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, repayTo, repaid_);
        collateral().safeTransfer(owner(), decollateralized);
```
5) the duration ended and Alice did not pay the loan so the loan become default , so Bob try to call `claimDefaulted()` to get the collateral of the loan , but this function will also revert , because this function tries to send the all 100 STA to Bob but the actual balance of the cooler of the STA tokens is 90 STA  , so Bob is prevented from claiming the defaulted loans . 


## Impact
loss of funds for the borrower and the lender , and prevent the owner from rescind the request that he made before , which is considered a loss of funds .

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
let the cooler deal with the actual amount of tokens the it was send to the contract by getting the balance of the cooler before and after all the transfer of tokens to the cooler contract , as shown here : 
consider applying this mechanism for all instances . 
```solidity
 balanceBefore = collateral.balanceOf(address(this));
        collateral().safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            collateralFor(amount_, loanToCollateral_)
        );
balanceAfter = collateral.balanceOf(address(this));

amountReceived = balanceAfter - balanceBefore ; 
loan.collateral = amountReceived ; 
```
