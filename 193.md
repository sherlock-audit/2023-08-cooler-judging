# Fixed exchange rate in a contract can cause Treasury depletion.
## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail


```solidity
uint256 public constant LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL = 3000e18;
```

The current price of `gOHM` is $2857, and the fixed exchange rate of 3000:1 in the contract can create arbitrage, which can deplete the Treasury.

Since the exchange rate is specified as a constant in the contract, changing it requires a vote through the DAO and a new deployment, so there is no immediate response to a price drop, which will eventually lead to the depletion of the Treasury.
