# Missing check in `Cooler.provideNewTermsForRoll` which allows lender to modify loan terms
## Summary

In `Cooler.provideNewTermsForRoll` the lender can pass `interest_`, `loanToCollateral_` and `duration_` and modify properties of an accepted (on-going) loan.

## Vulnerability Detail

The lender should not be able to change the terms of a loan once the borrower has accepted the existing terms. The function fails to verify if loan request was accepted by lender, and this could allow lender to steal collateral by increasing the interest rate and lowering the duration.

```solidity
function provideNewTermsForRoll(
        uint256 loanID_,
        uint256 interest_,
        uint256 loanToCollateral_,
        uint256 duration_
    ) external {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanID_];

        if (msg.sender != loan.lender) revert OnlyApproved();

        loan.request =
            Request(
                loan.amount,
                interest_,
                loanToCollateral_,
                duration_,
                true
            );
    }
```

## Impact
Loss of entire collateral for borrower.
