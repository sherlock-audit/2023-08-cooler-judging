# Inability to Execute `emergencyShutdown` Without `cooler_overseer` Role
## Summary
The `emergencyShutdown` function, designed to deactivate the contract and return funds to the treasury, cannot be executed by an account with only the "`emergency_shutdown`" role due to its dependency on the defund function, which requires the "`cooler_overseer`" role.

## Vulnerability Detail
Within the `emergencyShutdown` function, there are calls to the `defund` function. The `defund` function is protected by the `onlyRole("cooler_overseer")` modifier. This means that even if an account has the "`emergency_shutdown`" role, they cannot execute the `emergencyShutdown `function unless they also possess the "`cooler_overseer`" role.

## Impact
In emergency situations, the inability to shut down the contract quickly can lead to potential risks.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider restructuring the contract to allow the "`emergency_shutdown`" role to execute the `emergencyShutdown` function without needing the "`cooler_overseer`" role. This can be achieved by modifying the defund function to allow both roles to execute it or to have one role responsible for both operations.
