# `claimDefaulted()` can frontrun before user call the`transferOwnership()`
## Summary

`claimDefaulted()` can frontrun before user call the`transferOwnership()`

Let's assume this scenario:

Alice and Bob reached a certain transaction, and then Alice called function `approveTransfer()` to approve the ownership to Bob. At this time, Bob was going to call function `transferOwnership()` to transfer the ownership. However, at this time, the loan expired, and Alice uses the front-running transaction to call function `claimDefaulted()`, which will The collateral is transferred away, eventually causing Bob to lose funds

## Vulnerability Detail

As we can see, `claimDefaulted()` send the funds to loan.sender, but does not check if `approvals[loanID_] == address(0)`
```solidity
    function claimDefaulted(uint256 loanID_) external returns (uint256, uint256, uint256) {
        Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];
        delete loans[loanID_];

        if (block.timestamp <= loan.expiry) revert NoDefault();

        // Transfer defaulted collateral to the lender.
        collateral().safeTransfer(loan.lender, loan.collateral);//@audit

        // Log the event.
        factory().newEvent(loanID_, CoolerFactory.Events.DefaultLoan, 0);

        // If necessary, trigger lender callback.
        if (loan.callback) CoolerCallback(loan.lender).onDefault(loanID_, loan.amount, loan.collateral);
        return (loan.amount, loan.collateral, block.timestamp - loan.expiry);
    }
```
