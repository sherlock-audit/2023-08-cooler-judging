# Loan will be frozen after ownership transfer if new lender does not support callbacks
## Summary
The `Cooler` contracts allows the lender to transfer ownership of the loan to someone else. The problem is if the original lender supports callbacks but the new lender does not, then all callbacks will revert causing the loan to be frozen (no repayment, no roll, no claim).

## Vulnerability Detail
When a loan is created by a lender in `clearRequest`, the lender can set the value of `isCallback_` to `true` to indicate that it does support callbacks.

```solidity
File: Cooler.sol

L233: function clearRequest(
        uint256 reqID_,
        bool repayDirect_,
        bool isCallback_
    ) external returns (uint256 loanID) {
        Request memory req = requests[reqID_];

        // If necessary, ensure lender implements the CoolerCallback abstract.
        if (isCallback_ && !CoolerCallback(msg.sender).isCoolerCallback()) revert NotCoolerCallback(); // @audit check that original lender supports callbacks

L254:  loans.push(
            Loan({
                request: req,
                amount: req.amount + interest,
                unclaimed: 0,
                collateral: collat,
                expiry: expiration,
                lender: msg.sender,
                repayDirect: repayDirect_,
                callback: isCallback_ // @audit isCallback_ is stored in the loan struct
            })
        );
```

However, when the original lender transfers the ownership of the loan to a new lender, there is no check that the new lender supports callbacks the same way as the original lender does.

```solidity
File: Cooler.sol

L347: function transferOwnership(uint256 loanID_) external {
        if (msg.sender != approvals[loanID_]) revert OnlyApproved();

        // Update the load lender.
        loans[loanID_].lender = msg.sender;
        // Clear transfer approvals.
        approvals[loanID_] = address(0);
    }
```

This will freeze the loan and make it unusable because all the calls to `repayLoan()`, `rollLoan()` and `claimDefaulted()` will revert due to callbacks no being implemented by the lender.

 ```solidity
File: Cooler.sol

// Callback in repayLoan will revert making the repayLoan function unusable.
L185: if (loan.callback) CoolerCallback(loan.lender).onRepay(loanID_, repaid_);

// Callback in rollLoan will revert making the rollLoan function unusable.
L216: if (loan.callback) CoolerCallback(loan.lender).onRoll(loanID_, newDebt, newCollateral);

// Callback in claimDefaulted will revert making the claimDefaulted function unusable.
L331: if (loan.callback) CoolerCallback(loan.lender).onDefault(loanID_, loan.amount, loan.collateral);
```

## Impact
Loan will be frozen after an ownership transfer if the original lender allowing callbacks maliciously or unintentionally transfers the ownership to an address not implementing callbacks.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add this check to `transferOwnership()` function:
```diff
function transferOwnership(uint256 loanID_) external {
        if (msg.sender != approvals[loanID_]) revert OnlyApproved();
+       if (loans[loanID_].callback && !CoolerCallback(msg.sender).isCoolerCallback()) revert NotCoolerCallback();

        // Update the load lender.
        loans[loanID_].lender = msg.sender;
        // Clear transfer approvals.
        approvals[loanID_] = address(0);
    }
```
