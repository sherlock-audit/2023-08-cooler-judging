# Borrower has no choice whether to roll a loan. Lender could propose extreamly large interest rate, which will benefit the lender.
## Summary
Currently the cooler provides a functionallity, for a lender to propose new conditions for a loan and another function (supposed to be for the borrower, but anyone can call it. Even in the same trx as the one from the lender), which accept the new terms and modify the loan properties. If the intereset is changed, the user, who roll the loan don't have to pay anything, but the loan.amount is being increased in advantage to the lender.
## Vulnerability Detail
The severity is high, because the attack is easy to implement from a regular lender for each p2p cooler contract.
Here is the flow of the events. Assuming 1ETH = $2 000
1. Alice create a cooler, where she wants to borrow ETH and gives USDC as collateral. She creates initial request, where the want to borrow `1 ETH` with interest of `5%` (which is 1/20 ETH for a year), duration of `1 year` and `loanToCollateral of 3000` (150% value of the borrowed assets). So the amount, which Alice is okay to pay is back is 1.05 ETH ($2 100) for her loan of 1 ETH over the year.
2. The problem arises when maliciously intended Eve want to take advantage from Alice and the contract code:
```solidity
  function provideNewTermsForRoll(
        uint256 loanID_,
        uint256 interest_,
        uint256 loanToCollateral_,
        uint256 duration_
    ) external {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanID_];
        if (msg.sender != loan.lender) revert OnlyApproved();
	// Here Eve provide extremly large interest rate (let's say 200%)
        loan.request =
            Request(
                loan.amount,
                interest_,
                loanToCollateral_,
                duration_,
                true
            );
    }
```
- Eve clears the request by creating transffering Alice 1 ETH
- In one transaction Eve could propose new terms with no regulated interest value (it could go 100000% and more) and also accept those terms by calling `rollLoan()`
```solidity
 // @audit Why everybody can roll a loan?

        // Check whether rolling the loan requires pledging more collateral or not (if there was a previous repayment).
        uint256 newCollateral = newCollateralFor(loanID_);
        uint256 newDebt = interestFor(loan.amount, loan.request.interest, loan.request.duration);

        // Update memory accordingly.
        loan.amount += newDebt;
        loan.collateral += newCollateral;
        loan.expiry += loan.request.duration;
        loan.request.active = false;

        // Save updated loan info in storage.
        loans[loanID_] = loan;

        if (newCollateral > 0) {
            collateral().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newCollateral);
        }
```
- This operation is free for Eve, because she doesn't provide new loanToCollateral value, instead the function will increase loan.amount, which will manipulate decollateralized value in the `repayLoan` function, when Alice try to return her loan, which will lead to great loss of Alice funds. 
- - The best case scenario for her here is she looses only 50% of her initial collateral in value, if she leave the loan to be defaulted
- - Worse - she may miss that the terms are now changed and try to repay her 1 ETH back, which for new interest of (100000%) will decollaterize her 3 USDC (3000 (collateral) * 1 (repaid) / 1000 (amount after the new interest))
`uint256 decollateralized = (loan.collateral * repaid_) / loan.amount;`. So now she payed 1 ETH($2000) for $3 to the lender, who will later default $2997 from the collateral.

## Impact
- Borrowers paying too large interest back (almost certainly so large that they would prefer to loose their collateral funds)
- loan.amount being manipulated and so borrower lost funds in collateral or even borrowed asset, if they try to repay it.

This check will be invalid, if the new loan is with the same loanToValue, so the attacker don't have to sent funds.

## Recommendation
Be sure to check that only owner could roll the loan, after the lender has proposed so:
```solidity
 function rollLoan(uint256 loanID_) external {
        Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];
				// Add the following check
				if(msg.sender != owner) revert OnlyApproved();	
        if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) revert Default();
        if (!loan.request.active) revert NotRollable();
        // @audit Why everybody can roll a loan?
				...
```
