# Anyone can roll a loan
## Summary
When a loan is cleared, there's  a possibility to roll a loan over to extend this. This should be done by an agreement of both parties. While it's only possible to provide rollover conditions by the lender, anyone can roll the loan over. 
## Vulnerability Detail
providing new terms for the rollover is only available for the lender:

While the actual rollover function does not implement any functions to ensure msg.sender == owner of the request:

It might look like this is captured enough by the fact that msg.sender would need to transfer `newCollateral`, but this is only in the case where it's 0. 
The lender could indefinitely roll the loan over, also while interest is accrued. 
## Impact
Owner of request could end up with a loan that is extended indefinitely  where interest is accrued everytime.

## Recommendation
Implement access control where only the owner of the request can roll the loan
