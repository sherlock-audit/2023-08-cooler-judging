# A malicious lender can front-run ``rollLoan()``  to set additional ``duration_`` to 1 and ``interest_`` very high.
## Summary
``rollLoan()`` can be front run by a malicious lender by calling ``provideNewTermsForRoll()`` with ``duration_`` to 1 and ``interest_`` very high.

## Vulnerability Detail
A malicious lender can set ``provideNewTermsForRoll()`` with reasonable ``interest_``,  ``loanToCollateral_`` and ``duration_`` values such that ``borrower`` is willing to roll the loan by paying some more collateral. But, as soon as borrower calls ``rollloan()``, a malicious lender can front run that transaction with very high ``interest rate`` and ``duration = 1``. On doing this, the ``newDebt`` calculated and added to ``loan.amount`` will be very high, even higher than the collateral itself.

Hence, it's unlikely that borrower will be willing to pay more amount than the collateral itself to get the collateral back. 

Also, if ``loanToCollateral_`` is set very high, the ``newCollateral`` obtained and has to be paid by the ``borrower`` may be too large than what borrower has approved. To overcome this, borrower can set ``loanToCollateral_`` value same as he set for previous ``provideNewTermsForRoll()`` while front running such that the below code snippet won't revert.

## Impact
Borrower will lose all of his ``collateral`` which is generally more than the ``loan amount`` taken. Hence, this issue qualifies as a ``high`` severity.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
This can be mitigated very simply by adding a boolean such as:
```solidity
bool isRolling = false;
```
And ``rollLoan()`` and ``provideNewTermsForRoll`` should be modified such that:
```diff
    function rollLoan(uint256 loanID_) external {
        if (msg.sender != owner()) revert OnlyApproved();
        Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];

        if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) revert Default();
        if (!loan.request.active) revert NotRollable();

        // Check whether rolling the loan requires pledging more collateral or not (if there was a previous repayment).
        uint256 newCollateral = newCollateralFor(loanID_);
        uint256 newDebt = interestFor(loan.amount, loan.request.interest, loan.request.duration);

        // Update memory accordingly.
        loan.amount += newDebt;
        loan.collateral += newCollateral;
        loan.expiry += loan.request.duration;
        loan.request.active = false;

        // Save updated loan info in storage.
        loans[loanID_] = loan;

        if (newCollateral > 0) {
            collateral().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newCollateral);
        }

        // If necessary, trigger lender callback.
        if (loan.callback) CoolerCallback(loan.lender).onRoll(loanID_, newDebt, newCollateral);

+       isRolling = false;
    }
```

```diff 
    function provideNewTermsForRoll(uint256 loanID_, uint256 interest_, uint256 loanToCollateral_, uint256 duration_)
        external
    {
+      if (!isRolling) revert Deactivated();
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanID_];

        if (msg.sender != loan.lender) revert OnlyApproved();

        loan.request = Request(loan.amount, interest_, loanToCollateral_, duration_, true);
+      isRolling = true;
    }
```

This will prevent front running and also prevents the ``provideNewTermsForRoll()`` to be called multiple times by the lender. 

You can use uint256 constant values rather than boolean to save some gas.  One of the examples of using constants  is ``Openzeppelin's ReentrancyGuard.sol`` contract.
