# Lender can abuse borrower
## Summary
Lender can provideNewTerms for loan , lowering loanToCollateral ( to not transfer collateral for rolling the loan ) and set a big number as interest and a short time duration then roll the loan so huge amount of interest is applied and added to the debt . 
## Vulnerability Detail
when lender provides new terms for loan borrower should call rollLoan and transfer new collateral required for new terms , rollLoan function doesn't check whether caller is borrower of loan or not however since caller should pay required collateral it's not logical for someone to roll someone else loan , but if lender provide new terms with a loanToCollateral that is lower than original loanToCollateral there's no need to transfer additional collateral so anyone including lender can roll the loan on behalf of borrower , now lender is able to increase interest as much as he want such that it's not reasonable for borrower to repay loan and actually forces to default . 

## Scenario :
1 - Lender provides new term for loan , set loanToCollateral lower than before and a very high interest rate .
2 - Lender calls rollLoan of behalf of borrower without no cost as needed collateral is zero which is calculated as below line
```uint256 neededCollateral = collateralFor(loan.amount, loan.request.loanToCollateral);```
3 - New interest and duration is applied and added to the debt ( a small duration and a high interest ) .
4 - It's not reasonable for borrower to repay the debt so loan defaults . 
## Impact
Lenders can force the borrowers to default .

## Recommendation
Make sure only borrower of the loan can roll the loan or add a max interest cap.
