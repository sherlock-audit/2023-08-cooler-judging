# Malicious lender can Front-running `rolLoan()`
## Summary
The protocol offers a mechanism to rollover a loan. 
- Initially, the lender sets the new terms for the loan using the `provideNewTermsForRoll()` function. These terms define aspects like the interest rate and duration that the borrower will adhere to.
- Once the lender has established these terms, the borrower can proceed to call the `rollLoan()` function. This action lets borrowers refresh their loans with the new conditions, effectively extending their loan with the updated duration and interest rate. It's essential to note that the lender must determine these new terms in advance.

A vulnerability has been identified in the loan rollover process, allowing a malicious lender to front-run the borrower's transaction. This can result in the borrower unintentionally accepting unfavorable loan terms they never agreed to.

## Vulnerability Detail
The identified vulnerability revolves around the process of loan rollover. Let's say the process begins when a borrower, close to the expiration of their loan, negotiates with the lender to provide new terms for the loan via the provideNewTermsForRoll() function. However, after the lender sets these terms, there's an opportunity for the lender to front-run the borrower's acceptance (via `rollLoan()`) of the terms. The lender can send a transaction with a higher gas price to modify these terms, requiring more collateral, higher interest, and a shorter duration or even worse with zero duration. Consequently, when the borrower tries to accept the terms using the `rollLoan()` function, they inadvertently accept these malicious terms set by the front-running transaction of the lender.

Potential exploit scenario is:
1. A borrower's loan is nearing its expiration.
2. The borrower asks the lender to set new terms for the loan via the `provideNewTermsForRoll()` function. Both parties `agree on specific terms` for the new duration, collateral, and interest.
3. The lender calls provideNewTermsForRoll() with the agreed-upon terms.
4. When the borrower attempts to call the rollLoan() function to accept the new terms, however a malicious lender can `front-run` this transaction by setting different terms (more collateral, higher interest, and shorter duration) by again calling the `provideNewTermsForRoll()` function with a higher gas fee.
5. The borrower's rollLoan() function then gets executed with these unfavorable terms, putting the borrower at a significant disadvantage.

Even worse scenario is if the lender call `provideNewTermsForRoll()` function with very high collateral and zero duration, so in `rollLoan()` loan's expiry `remains unchanged` due to the addition of a zero (`loan.expiry += loan.request.duration`).

## Impact
The borrower can end up locked into unfavorable terms that they never agreed upon. They could find themselves providing more collateral than initially discussed, paying higher interest rates, and having less time or even no time to repay. Such an event can have severe financial implications for the borrower.

## Code Snippet
Procedure for Providing New Terms for a Loan Rollover:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler-radeveth/blob/main/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol#L282-L300
```solidity
    function provideNewTermsForRoll(
        uint256 loanID_,
        uint256 interest_,
        uint256 loanToCollateral_,
        uint256 duration_
    ) external {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanID_];

        if (msg.sender != loan.lender) revert OnlyApproved();

        loan.request =
            Request(
                loan.amount,
                interest_,
                loanToCollateral_,
                duration_,
                true
            );
    }
```

Rolling a loan over with new terms:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler-radeveth/blob/main/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol#L192-L217
```solidity
    function rollLoan(uint256 loanID_) external {
        Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];

        if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) revert Default();
        if (!loan.request.active) revert NotRollable();

        // Check whether rolling the loan requires pledging more collateral or not (if there was a previous repayment).
        uint256 newCollateral = newCollateralFor(loanID_);
        uint256 newDebt = interestFor(loan.amount, loan.request.interest, loan.request.duration);

        // Update memory accordingly.
        loan.amount += newDebt;
        loan.collateral += newCollateral;
        loan.expiry += loan.request.duration;
        loan.request.active = false;

        // Save updated loan info in storage.
        loans[loanID_] = loan;

        if (newCollateral > 0) {
            collateral().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newCollateral);
        }

        // If necessary, trigger lender callback.
        if (loan.callback) CoolerCallback(loan.lender).onRoll(loanID_, newDebt, newCollateral);
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To prevent this front-running vulnerability, it's recommended to introduce an additional confirmation step or a locking mechanism:

1. Locking Mechanism: Once the lender has provided terms using provideNewTermsForRoll(), restrict any new term changes for a predetermined time period. This buffer ensures the borrower has a safe window to accept terms without interference.

2. Borrower Confirmation: Implement a confirmation mechanism where the borrower must first validate the provided terms before they can be used. Introduce an intermediary function that the borrower must call to confirm their acceptance of the terms. Only post this confirmation can the loan then be rolled over.

By implementing the above recommendations, it would ensure that once terms are decided upon, they cannot be maliciously altered without the explicit confirmation of the borrower, safeguarding against the outlined front-running attack.
