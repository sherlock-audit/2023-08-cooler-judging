# `rollLoan` caller will lose his collateral tokens if he is not the loan borrower
## Summary

Since `rollLoan` function is accessible by anyone; `rollLoan` caller will lose his collateral tokens if he is not the loan borrower.

## Vulnerability Detail

- Rolling a loan typically refers to extending the duration of an existing loan by refinancing it or obtaining a new loan to repay the current one.
- This process is often done to avoid defaulting on the original loan while providing additional time to repay the borrowed funds.
- In `Cooler.sol`: any loan can be rolled (modifying its conditions such as duration,amount,...).
- Rolling a loan can only be done after the loan lender calls `provideNewTermsForRoll` function with a new loan parameters; interest rate, loanToCollateral & duration.
- But `rollLoan` function can be called by anyone (not only by the borrower) without gaining any benefits; the `rollLoan` caller will not get debt tokens in return of his sent collateral tokens.

## Impact

So if the caller is not the borrower; this will result in the `rollLoan` caller losing his collateral tokens without getting any debt tokens in return.

## Code Snippet

[rollLoan function](https://github.com/ohmzeus/Cooler/blob/c6f2bbe1b51cdf3bb4d078875170177a1b8ba2a3/src/Cooler.sol#L192-L217)

       ```solidity
         function rollLoan(uint256 loanID_) external {
        Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];

        if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) revert Default();
        if (!loan.request.active) revert NotRollable();

        // Check whether rolling the loan requires pledging more collateral or not (if there was a previous repayment).
        uint256 newCollateral = newCollateralFor(loanID_);
        uint256 newDebt = interestFor(loan.amount, loan.request.interest, loan.request.duration);

        // Update memory accordingly.
        loan.amount += newDebt;
        loan.collateral += newCollateral;
        loan.expiry += loan.request.duration;
        loan.request.active = false;

        // Save updated loan info in storage.
        loans[loanID_] = loan;

        if (newCollateral > 0) {
            collateral().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newCollateral);
        }

        // If necessary, trigger lender callback.
        if (loan.callback) CoolerCallback(loan.lender).onRoll(loanID_, newDebt, newCollateral);
    }
       ```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Modify `rollLoan` function to be only accessible by the borrower:

```diff
    function rollLoan(uint256 loanID_) external {
+      require(msg.sender==owner());
       //... rest of the function
    }
```
