# Cooler#rollLoan anyone can call rollLoan and change the loan terms without borrower agreeing
## Summary
When a lender provides new terms for a loan, the borrower can accept them via the rollLoan function. The problem here is there is no check who is executing the rollLoan function which can lead to roll a loan although the borrower hasn't agreed with the new terms.  

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's consider the following scenario:
1. A malicious lender lends a loan with good terms for the borrower.
2. After that decides to change the terms entirely in his favour. For example, much higher interest and much less duration.
3. The borrower doesn't agree and won't execute rollLoan.
4. The lender executes rollLoan although the borrower's opinion

## Impact
The lender can change the loan terms in his favour.
