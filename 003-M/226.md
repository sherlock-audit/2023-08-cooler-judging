# Malicious Lender can Frontrun `repay` transaction and potentially steal `debt` through price Slippage
## Summary

Malicious lenders can frontrun the `repay` transaction of borrower and can inflate the loan amount through rolling the loan for small duration with extremely high interest rate, resulting in borrowers receiving insignificant collateral for the Debt token paid and being forced to default due to the inflated value. Subsequently, the lender gains control over both collateral and debt tokens, leaving the borrower with nothing.

## Vulnerability Detail

Consider the following Situation:

1. Alice deployed a USDC/WETH Cooler.

2. Alice requests a loan of 4000 USDC against 2 WETH collateral for a 30-day period.

3. Bob responds to the request and clears it through clearRequest.

4. At any point before the `expiry` time, Alice calls `repay` for `4000 USDC` amount + `50 USDC` interest = `4050 USDC` (assuming 50 USDC interest).

5. Bob monitors Alice's transaction in the mempool and deploys a script to frontrun her transaction.

6. Bob calls `provideNewTermsForRoll`, setting `interest_` to an exceptionally high value and `duration` to `1` second.

```solidity

  function provideNewTermsForRoll(
        uint256 loanID_,
        uint256 interest_,
        uint256 loanToCollateral_,
        uint256 duration_
    ) external {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanID_];

        if (msg.sender != loan.lender) revert OnlyApproved();

        loan.request = 
            Request(
                loan.amount,
                interest_,
                loanToCollateral_,
                duration_,
                true
            );
    }

```

7. Next Bob calls to `rollLoan`. Bob can call it as it has no access control.

```solidity

  function rollLoan(uint256 loanID_) external { 
        // ---------- SNIP ----------- //

        if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) revert Default();
        

        // Check whether rolling the loan requires pledging more collateral or not (if there was a previous repayment).
        uint256 newCollateral = newCollateralFor(loanID_);
        uint256 newDebt = interestFor(loan.amount, loan.request.interest, loan.request.duration);

        // Update memory accordingly.
@->     loan.amount += newDebt;
        loan.collateral += newCollateral;
        loan.expiry += loan.request.duration;
        loan.request.active = false;

        // Save updated loan info in storage.
        loans[loanID_] = loan;

        if (newCollateral > 0) {
            collateral().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newCollateral);
        }

        // ---------- SNIP ----------- //
    }

```

Here, `newCollateralFor` will be `0` as Bob has not changed the `loanToCollateral` factor.

So this manipulation results in only two state variables changes:
* `loan.amount` will sky rocket by addition of `newDebt` due to the manipulated `loan.request.interest`.
* `loan.expiry` will increase by just `1` second.

8. Now, when Alice's repayment transaction for 4050 USDC arrives: 

```solidity

158:    uint256 decollateralized = (loan.collateral * repaid_) / loan.amount;

```

The collateral to be redeemed, calculated by `(loan.collateral * repaid_) / loan.amount`, becomes almost negligible due to the inflated `loan.amount`.

```solidity

162:    loan.amount -= repaid_;
163:    loan.collateral -= decollateralized;

178:    debt().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, repayTo, repaid_);
179:    collateral().safeTransfer(owner(), decollateralized);

```

As a result, the entire `4050 USDC` is paid to the `lender`, while the `borrower` receives a minimal collateral amount.

Given the unrealistic inflation of `loan.amount`, Alice is forced to default since repaying would be financially irrational.

The lender, Bob, can claim collateral tokens upon the loan's expiration by calling `claimDefaulted`.

## Impact

Complete loss of collateral and debt tokens for the owner.

## Recommendation

2 Possible solutions:

1. Implement a price slippage parameter: `minDecollateralized` which the borrower needs to pass in the function argument. Add a required check at the end of `repay` to make sure that borrower is getting enough collateral for the Debt token he/she paid.

2. Add an access control on `rollLoan` such that only borrower can call it.
