# Front-running vulnerability of Cooler.solâ€™s rollLoan
## Summary
The vulnerability allows a malicious lender to front-run the borrower and manipulate loan terms in a way that can lead to significant losses for the borrower. The attacker can force the borrower into an un-repayable loan condition, leading to default  and effectively steals the borrower's collateral.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the context of dedicated Cooler usage without  the integration with the Clearinghouse, the issue arises because the Cooler lets `provideNewTermsForRoll` to be called multiple times and it also lacks a front-run protection for `rollLoan` which should help the borrower dictates his outcome expectations via input parameters (based on pre-determined loan terms).

The attack can be described as belows:

```solidity
// Findings are labeled with '<= FOUND'
// File: Cooler/src/Cooler.sol
192:    function rollLoan(uint256 loanID_) external {...}// <= FOUND: lacks slippage protection
        ...
282:    function provideNewTermsForRoll(){...}// <= FOUND: allows multi-calls
        ...
371:    function collateralFor(uint256 amount_, uint256 loanToCollateral_) public view returns (uint256) {
372:        return (amount_ * (10 ** collateral().decimals())) / loanToCollateral_; // <= FOUND: smaller loanToCollateral_ -> higher collateralFor
373:    }
        ...
377:    function newCollateralFor(uint256 loanID_) public view returns (uint256) {
378:        ...
380:        uint256 neededCollateral = collateralFor(
381:            loan.amount,
382:            loan.request.loanToCollateral // <= FOUND: smaller loanToCollateral -> higher neededCollateral
383:        );
384:        ...
389:    }
```

1. The malicious lender (Alice) decides to enable her existing loan for rolling over by calling `provideNewTermsForRoll` with the attractive figures of `interest`, `loanToCollateral`, and `duration`.
2. The borrower (Bob) accepts the loan terms by approving maximum collateral (common behavior of end-user) and calls `rollLoan`.
3. While Bob's transaction is pending, Alice front-runs another `provideNewTermsForRoll` (since there's no constraints for the lender to call again) but lowers the `loanToCollateral` ratio. From line 381-382, now that `loan.amount` stays the same and `loan.request.loanToCollateral` gets smaller, line 372 would produce a larger value of collateral. With a precomputed value of `loanToCollateral` ratio, Alice could make Bob's entire collateral balance allowance to be pulled to the Cooler. Alice also increases the `interest` to the maximum possible value and sets the `duration` to 1.
4. Bob's transaction is executed, and a new loan is rolled over with unfavorable conditions, making it un-repayable due to an extremely large debt.
5. Alice waits until the loan expires within a short period and calls `claimDefaulted` to obtain the collateral.

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is significant:
1. An larger-than-expected amount of the borrower's collateral could be pulled to the Cooler contract, which can be up to the borrower's collateral allowance (likely to be the maximum for most users).
2. The attacker can manipulate the loan's interest and duration, potentially forcing it into an un-repayable state and causing the borrower to default.
From these chains of actions, the malicious lender can steal all of the borrower's collateral funds.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement one of the following:
1. Allow calling `provideNewTermsForRoll` only once by checking if `loan.request.active` is already set. This prevents multiple manipulations of loan terms.
2. Let the caller provide their expected loan terms for the `rollLoan` parameters (ie. max collateral, max interest, min duration allowed), and validate those values against the actual loan settings. This ensures that the loan terms are not manipulated by attackers during the loan rolling process.
