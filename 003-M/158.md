# Anyone can call rollLoan function

## Summary
In the context of lending, the rollLoan function is open for anyone to use. This function allows borrowers to accept new terms offered by the lender. However, a issue arises as there are no checks in place to verify the identity of the caller of the rollLoan function. This flaw could potentially lead to the execution of a loan roll even if the borrower has not consented to the updated terms.

## Vulnerability Detail
Consider the following scenarios:

A malicious lender provides favorable terms for a loan to the borrower initially.
Subsequently, the lender decides to alter the terms drastically in their own favor. This might involve introducing significantly higher interest rates and reducing the loan duration.
Despite the borrower's refusal to accept the new terms, the borrower chooses not to execute the rollLoan function to signify their disagreement.
In an unexpected turn, the lender manages to trigger the rollLoan function without obtaining the borrower's consent.

## Impact
Loss of funds for the borrower.
