# Anyone can accept new terms by calling `rollLoan` due to lack of access control.
## Summary
Lack of access control allows for anyone to accept unfavorable loan terms with `rollLoan`

## Vulnerability Detail
After a loan is accepted, the loan lender can propose new terms for the loan via `provideNewTermsForRoll`
```solidity
    function provideNewTermsForRoll(
        uint256 loanID_,
        uint256 interest_,
        uint256 loanToCollateral_,
        uint256 duration_
    ) external {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanID_];

        if (msg.sender != loan.lender) revert OnlyApproved();

        loan.request =
            Request(
                loan.amount,
                interest_,
                loanToCollateral_,
                duration_,
                true
            );
    }
```
In order to be accepted, `rollLoan` must be called. However, since there is no access control, anyone can accept the new terms, even if they are unfavorable for the borrower. The lender can abuse this by proposing high interest rate and accepting it himself, forcing the borrower to overpay.
```solidity
    function rollLoan(uint256 loanID_) external {
        Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];

        if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) revert Default();
        if (!loan.request.active) revert NotRollable();

        // Check whether rolling the loan requires pledging more collateral or not (if there was a previous repayment).
        uint256 newCollateral = newCollateralFor(loanID_);
        uint256 newDebt = interestFor(loan.amount, loan.request.interest, loan.request.duration);

        // Update memory accordingly.
        loan.amount += newDebt;
        loan.collateral += newCollateral;
        loan.expiry += loan.request.duration;
        loan.request.active = false;

        // Save updated loan info in storage.
        loans[loanID_] = loan;

        if (newCollateral > 0) {
            collateral().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newCollateral);
        }

        // If necessary, trigger lender callback.
        if (loan.callback) CoolerCallback(loan.lender).onRoll(loanID_, newDebt, newCollateral);
    }`
```


## Impact
Owner can propose new unfavorable terms and force borrower into accepting them.
