# Malicious lender can increase loan.amount
## Summary
Lender can `provideNewTermsForRoll` and `rollLoan` on behalf of borrower when no new collateral is needed. 
## Vulnerability Detail
Let's take a look at `provideNewTermsForRoll`:
```solidity
loan.request =
            Request(
                loan.amount,
                interest_,
                loanToCollateral_,
                duration_,
                true
            );
```
Lender can carefully craft a new `Request` that will not require `newCollateral` when `rollLoan()` is called:
```solidity
// Check whether rolling the loan requires pledging more collateral or not (if there was a previous repayment).
        uint256 newCollateral = newCollateralFor(loanID_);
        uint256 newDebt = interestFor(loan.amount, loan.request.interest, loan.request.duration);

        // Update memory accordingly.
        loan.amount += newDebt;
        loan.collateral += newCollateral;
        loan.expiry += loan.request.duration;
        loan.request.active = false;

        // Save updated loan info in storage.
        loans[loanID_] = loan;
```
Since there is not sanity check, Lender is able to call `rollLoan()` on behalf of borrower. As a consequence, to increase the amount that has to be repaid.
## Impact
Borrower has to repay more than expected in order to avoid

## Recommendation
```solidity
function rollLoan(uint256 loanID_) external {
+      if(msg.sender != owner()) revert();
        Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];

        if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) revert Default();
        if (!loan.request.active) revert NotRollable();

        // Check whether rolling the loan requires pledging more collateral or not (if there was a previous repayment).
        uint256 newCollateral = newCollateralFor(loanID_);
        uint256 newDebt = interestFor(loan.amount, loan.request.interest, loan.request.duration);

        // Update memory accordingly.
        loan.amount += newDebt;
        loan.collateral += newCollateral;
        loan.expiry += loan.request.duration;
        loan.request.active = false;

        // Save updated loan info in storage.
        loans[loanID_] = loan;

        if (newCollateral > 0) {
            collateral().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newCollateral);
        }

        // If necessary, trigger lender callback.
        if (loan.callback) CoolerCallback(loan.lender).onRoll(loanID_, newDebt, newCollateral);
    }
```
