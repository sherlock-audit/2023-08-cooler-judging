# If new terms reduce collateral ratio, no collateral is refunded
## Summary
If new terms reduce collateral ratio, no collateral is refunded

## Vulnerability Detail
After a loan is active, the lender can propose new terms for it, which the borrower can then accepted. The problem is that if the new terms are accepted and `collateralRatio` is reduced enough so the needed collateral is less than what it was originally, no collateral is then refunded to the user, although it should be. 
```solidity
    function newCollateralFor(uint256 loanID_) public view returns (uint256) {
        Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];
        // Accounts for all outstanding debt (borrowed amount + interest).
        uint256 neededCollateral = collateralFor(
            loan.amount,
            loan.request.loanToCollateral
        );

        return
            neededCollateral > loan.collateral ?
            neededCollateral - loan.collateral :
            0;
    }
```
It only checks if `neededCollateral` is more and new collateral should be deposited. 

## Impact
User isn't refunded their collateral when they should be.
