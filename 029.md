# Various low issues
## Summary

Low issues found collected here. Setting label to "Medium" because Sherlock removed "Low" from the label list.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. In `Clearinghouse.rebalance`, `sdai.approve` call is erroneous because function uses transfer instead of transferFrom. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Clearinghouse.sol#L318

2. After reactivating, the Clearinghouse may have to wait up to 7 days before it can resume making loans.

3. Having a hardcoded ratio of 3000 DAI/gOhm is very dangerous, especially because gOhm currently trades at under 3000 DAI.

4. Having the debt of the Clearinghouse denominated in DAI seems  bad because the sDAI/DAI  ratio can change.

5. Clearinghouse.claimDefaulted checks neither the lender nor the currency. So it's possible for some to make up a new coin, mint themselves 2**255 tokens, lend it all to themselves, default on the loan, and then call Clearinghouse.claimDefaulted. So long as they can make it so it doesn't try to burn non-existent gOhm, then they can drive the debt of the Clearinghouse to 0. I have found no on-chain consequences to this number being wrong, even after looking through the Olympus code.

6. totalInterest is calculated incorrectly in Clearinghouse.claimDefaulted. It appears the goal is to try to compute the original amount lent, before interest. But, for a loan that has not been rolled over, it actually computes (original amount lended + original interest) * interest rate, getting a number which is too high. If  the loan has been rolled over, then it's even more wrong.  I have found no on-chain consequences to this number being wrong, even after looking through the Olympus code.
