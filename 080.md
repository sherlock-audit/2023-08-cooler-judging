# Lack of access control on the rollLoan function exposes borrowers to bad loan conditions
## Summary
The absence of proper access control at the rollLoan function enables lenders to roll the terms of a loan, allowing them to potentially trap borrowers in situations where repaying the loan becomes unfeasible and recouping their collateral unrealistic. While the lender's ability to propose new terms through the "provideNewTermsForRoll" function is intended, the vulnerability permits lenders to unilaterally impose modified terms without borrower consent. This manipulation can lead to borrowers facing repayment obligations that surpass the initial terms, increasing the risk of loan defaults and potential financial ruin.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability stems from the "rollLoan" function's absence of proper access control (1). While borrowers are meant to renew loans with new terms using this function, it fails to prevent unauthorized parties, especially lenders, from exploiting it to change loan terms without borrower agreement.

This vulnerability empowers malicious lenders to significantly raise loan amounts while keeping collateral requirements low, as no checks exist for interest rate limits or collateral ratios (2). This manipulation can result in borrowers facing repayment obligations far beyond the original agreement, increasing the chances of loan defaults and potential financial distress.

A crucial point involves the borrower's inability to reject or prevent modifications to loan terms, as anyone can call the rollLoan function. This lack of control leaves borrowers susceptible to facing repayment obligations disproportionate to their provided collateral.

Furthermore, a significant impact arises from a specific code line within the "repayLoan" function(3) and code snippet 4 from "rollLoan."

The snippets illustrate how lenders can inflate the loan amount without a corresponding increase in collateral. By raising the loan amount while maintaining collateral, lenders create a scenario where borrowers must significantly increase their repayment amount to regain their collateral. This starkly increases the likelihood of loan defaults, resulting in collateral loss and potential financial ruin.

(1) See code snippet 1 for the "rollLoan" function.
(2) Refer to code snippet 2 for the absence of proper checks on interest rate limits and collateral ratios.
(3) Examine code snippet 3 for the impactful code line within the "repayLoan" function.

## Impact
This vulnerability affects borrowers a lot. Bad actors can raise loan amounts without needing more collateral, making borrowers owe much more than they agreed to. This increases the chance that borrowers can't repay the loan within the time they're given. Ultimately, borrowers may lose their collateral, and lenders can unfairly benefit from this situation. This damages the fairness and trust in the lending platform.

Special focus to line 158:
```solidity
       uint256 decollateralized = (loan.collateral * repaid_) / loan.amount;
```

```solidity
        uint256 newCollateral = newCollateralFor(loanID_);
        uint256 newDebt = interestFor(loan.amount, loan.request.interest, loan.request.duration);

        // Update memory accordingly.
        loan.amount += newDebt;
        loan.collateral += newCollateral;
        loan.expiry += loan.request.duration;
        loan.request.active = false;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement access control on the rollLoan function. Access should be restricted to the original borrower or a specific set of authorized addresses. Additionally, when implementing the provideNewTermsForRoll function, careful consideration should be given to any changes in loan terms to ensure fairness and avoid exposing borrowers to unrealistic repayment obligations.
