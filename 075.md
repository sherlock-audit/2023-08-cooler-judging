# Insecure Token Allowance in `lendToCooler` Function
## Summary
The `lendToCooler` function in the provided contract approves the transfer of `gOHM` tokens to a Cooler contract using the `approve` function. This can lead to vulnerabilities if the underlying ERC20 token's `approve` function does not return a boolean value. To mitigate this, the contract should use `safeApprove` instead of approve.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `lendToCooler` function, the contract approves the transfer of `gOHM` tokens to the Cooler contract with the following code:
```solidity
gOHM.approve(address(cooler_), collateral);
```
The problem arises if the `approve` function of the `gOHM` token does not return a boolean value to indicate the success or failure of the approval. Some ERC20 token implementations return `bool` to indicate approval success, while others may not.

If the underlying `approve` function does not return a boolean, there is no way for the contract to know whether the approval was successful or not. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities.
## Impact
The vulnerability could lead to situations where tokens are transferred without proper approval, or the contract might proceed with other operations assuming the approval was successful when it was not. This can result in incorrect contract behavior, loss of funds, and a risk of reentrancy attacks.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It's recommended to use the `safeApprove` function provided by the OpenZeppelin library. The `safeApprove` function handles the uncertainty of whether the underlying approve function returns a boolean value.
