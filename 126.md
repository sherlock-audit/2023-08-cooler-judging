# Collateral amount computed incorrectly
## Summary

Factor in interest when computing collateral. 

## Vulnerability Detail


In requestLoan (Cooler.sol):

```solidity
collateral().safeTransferFrom(
   msg.sender,
   address(this),
   collateralFor(amount_, loanToCollateral_)
);
```

You need to factor in the interest when calculating the collateral requested (so just use modify `collateralFor` and `newCollateralFor` a bit to add in an interest rate and duration value). Your model is that the interest for the entire duration of the loan must be repaid, so if you don't do this, even if `loanToCollateral_` represents the current price of gOHM, the loan will likely naturally go underwater because of the interest.

Note that this is not an issue for users taking loans directly from the ClearingHouse (I doubt interest rate 0.5% matters); it only ever becomes an issue in the peer to peer case where a borrower requests a loan directly through the cooler and another lender fulfills it (in this case the interest rate likely matters a lot more). The P2P case however seems quite important since in the Factory you can create coolers for non gOHM (collateral)/DAI (debt) pairs. 

## Impact

Loans will go underwater
