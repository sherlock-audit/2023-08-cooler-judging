# Users purposefully create defaulted loans to gain keeper reward by calling `claimDefaulted` later
## Summary

Because there is no penalty for defaulted loans, users can purposely create loans with the ClearingHouse, never pay them back, and partake in opportunities to call `claimDefaulted` on these loans later on. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The first step is for an attacker to create a loan with the ClearingHouse. The attacker will send in gOHM to do so and receive DAI. The attacker will proceed to never pay back the loan but will partake in opportunities to call `claimDefaulted` after the loan has defaulted, potentially making money. The reason this happens is because there is currently no margin implemented between the amount of debt and the amount of collateral required, so a loan defaulting has no penalties for the borrower, but the protocol loses money every time a default happens.  

## Impact

Protocol will lose money every time someone purposely creates one of these default loans and gains reward for calling `claimDefaulted`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use some type of price feed for gOHM and add some type of margin to ensure that users can lose something by defaulting (e.g. make the LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL value the fair price of gOHM from the price feed + 5% or so).
