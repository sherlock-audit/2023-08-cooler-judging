# Utilize safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom consistently instead of transfer/transferFrom
## Summary
Use safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom instead of trasfer/transferFrom to secure token transfer process.

## Vulnerability Detail
In some cases, some token does not revert (eg. ZRX) and some do not return status (eg. USDT).  It is highly recommended to utilize safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom to secure token transfer. 
If status remains unchecked might lead to unintended behaviors. Related discussion can be found in [here](https://consensys.io/diligence/audits/2021/01/fei-protocol/#unchecked-return-value-for-transferfrom-calls).
## Impact
Take one of the vulnerable function as example.

```solidity
function defund(ERC20 token_, uint256 amount_) public onlyRole("cooler_overseer") {
   if (token_ == gOHM) revert OnlyBurnable();
   if (token_ == sdai || token_ == dai) {
        // Since users loans are denominated in DAI, the clearinghouse
        // debt is set in DAI terms. It must be adjusted when defunding.
        uint256 outstandingDebt = TRSRY.reserveDebt(dai, address(this));
        uint256 daiAmount = (token_ == sdai)
            ? sdai.previewRedeem(amount_)
            : amount_;
  
        TRSRY.setDebt({
            debtor_: address(this),
            token_: dai,
            amount_: (outstandingDebt > daiAmount) ? outstandingDebt - daiAmount : 0
        });
    }
    token_.transfer(address(TRSRY), amount_);
}
```

If the token transfer in `refund` does not complete and does not revert, there refunding process will fail.
