# `rollLoan` is vulnerable to front-running
## Summary

A malicious lender is able to front-run `rollLoan` and increases debt amount.

## Vulnerability Detail

- Lender provides new terms for rolling over the loan.
- Borrower accepts and calls `rollLoan`.
- Lender front-runs the borrower transaction and calls `provideNewTermsForRoll` with new terms (for example he sets a higher number for interest which leads to higher debt amount for borrower).

## Impact

Borrower may pay more collateral and repay as much as lender ask.
