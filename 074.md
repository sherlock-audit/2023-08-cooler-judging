# Missing Token Transfer Verification in `lendToCooler` Function
## Summary
The `lendToCooler` function in the provided contract transfers `gOHM` tokens from the sender's address to the contract's address using the `transferFrom` function. However, the function does not include a check for the success of the token transfer. Failing to verify the success of the transfer can lead to unexpected behavior, including potential loss of funds.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `lendToCooler` function is responsible for enabling users to lend DAI to a Cooler contract by providing `gOHM` tokens as collateral. One of the critical steps in this process is the transfer of `gOHM` tokens from the sender's address to the contract's address. The relevant code snippet is as follows:
```solidity
gOHM.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), collateral);
```
While this code initiates the token transfer, it lacks a subsequent verification of the transfer's success or failure. Without such verification, the contract assumes that the transfer will always succeed, which could lead to unintended behavior if the transfer fails for any reason.
## Impact
 If the token transfer fails (due to various reasons, such as insufficient allowance, lack of balance, or external contract reverts), the contract's state could become inconsistent. Users might unintentionally lose their funds or experience incorrect behavior due to the contract's assumption of a successful transfer.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```solidity
require(gOHM.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), collateral), "Transfer of gOHM tokens failed");
```
By including this verification, the contract will revert the transaction and provide an error message if the token transfer fails. This ensures that the contract's state remains consistent, and users are notified of any transfer failures immediately.
