# Rounding error possible in requestLoan
## Summary
It's possible to create a request with a high enough `loanToCollateral` so that the actual collateral that is transferred == 0.
## Vulnerability Detail
When creating a loan, `loanToCollateral` is used for advertising the amount of collateral that the loan is backed by and for the calculation of the transfer.

The calculation of the amount to transfer is exposed to rounding error. 
If we would input a high enough `loanToCollateral`, amount of 0 is send while the loan is advertised with the high collateral amount.
The owner of the request could simply let the loan default while holding all the received funds
## Impact
Lender will lose the loaned amount while not receiving any collateral

## Recommendation
You could change the calculation in order to avoid rounding errors or simply check for `amount != 0`
