# Fee on transfer tokens have incorrect accounting when lending/borrowing/rolling
## Summary

The contracts perform accounting based on the amounts that correlate to those in the transfer() and safeTransferFrom functions. This affects the Cooler contract can work with any ERC20, which is different from ClearingHouse which is for DAI and gOHM. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The contracts perform accounting based on the amounts that correlate to those in the transfer() and safeTransferFrom functions. When fee-on-transfer tokens are transferred, during the `repayLoan()` function, `roll` function and `clearLoan` function, the tokens transferred to the contract are less than those that were accounted for

```solidity
        debt().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, owner(), req.amount);
```

## Impact
- Incorrect accounting and loss of funds when fee-on-transfer tokens are used in cooler

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Do not allow fee-on-transfer tokens in the Cooler contract, or ensure that the tokens receieved are the same as those transferred.
