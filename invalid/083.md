# Pausable Tokens Could Prevent Borrower From Repaying Debt Leading to Loan Default
## Summary

Issue related to pausable tokens and generating a Cooler with them.

## Vulnerability Detail

When examining a scenario for an arbitrary Cooler generated that includes a Pausable token as the debt token, such as `BNB` or `ZIL` (collateral token could be anything, let's say USDC):

It is possible that due to some situation the owner of the pausable token's protocol initiates a `pause()` on the token. If a loan is already taken out for that Cooler where the pausable token is debt, the borrower would not be able to repay back his debt (as the attempt to transfer would fail and revert), and that could lead to the loan defaulting if the pause is initiated near the end of the expiry timeframe.

Order of events:

1. A cooler is generated for e.g. a ZIL/USDT debt/collateral pair.
2. Borrower requests a loan and lender clears the request.
3. Some time passes and the expiry date is nearing.
4. Owners of `ZIL` token initiate a `pause()` on the token's functionality due to an event.
5. Borrower tries to repay back his debt but the transaction fails and reverts.
6. Borrower is not able to repay back his debt before the `loan.expiry`.
7. Loan defaults and borrower loses his collateral.

## Impact

This leads to the borrower not being able to repay back his debt if the token is paused (hence transfers revert), `loan.expiry` is reached and the loan defaults.

## Code Snippet

None

## Tool used

VSCode, Manual Review

## Recommendation
One potentioal solution would be to create a whitelist that does not allow for pausable tokens to be used in generating Coolers with the factory.
