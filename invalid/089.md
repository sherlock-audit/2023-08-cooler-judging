# `Cooler.sol`: `clearRequest` can be re-entered to drain contract
## Summary

`Cooler.sol`: `clearRequest` can be re-entered to drain contract

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `clearRequest` is used to match against a loan request and fill it. The issue is that the function has no re-entrancy protection, and does an external callback to the msg.sender. This can be used to match against the same loan multiple times. So the borrower is cahrged the collateral once, but the lender can match against it multiple times and then liquidate it to extract the collateral multiple times, draining the contract.

The function `clearRequest` takes a request id. It then checks if there is a callback, and then does an external call. The important thing to note is that the request `req` is loaded from storage into the memory before the callback happens.

```solidity
Request memory req = requests[reqID_];
// If necessary, ensure lender implements the CoolerCallback abstract.
if (isCallback_ && !CoolerCallback(msg.sender).isCoolerCallback())
    revert NotCoolerCallback();
```

Assume the lender is malicious, and has set `isCallBack_` as true and has implemented an `isCoolerCallBack` function. Inside this function, the msg sender re-enters this same function again with the same request, and `isCallBack_` set to false. Lets say the first call is instance A, and the second call via the re-entrancy is instance B.

In instance A, the request is loaded into the memory. In the second instance B, the storage hasnt been changed yet, and the same state is loaded again to memory in the variable `req`. After this code segment, the status of the `req` is checked.

```solidity
// Ensure loan request is active.
if (!req.active) revert Deactivated();

// Clear the loan request in memory.
req.active = false;
```

In instance B, this check will pass, since its the first time the request is being processed. After this code, the actual loaning happens. The control then falls back to instance A, which is where the re-entrancy attack started from via the callback.

In instance A, this check still passes. This is because even though the `req.active` was set to false in the re-entrant call, the value from storage was loaded into memory before the re-entrancy happened. So the value in `req.active` is still true. So the contract will match the same loan request again.

## Impact

The issue is that the same loan is matched multiple times. Assume the borrower sets up a collateral worth 150USD, and requests a loan for 100USD worth. If the lender matches this request twice, they will pay the borrower twice, giving them 200USD. The lender can then liquidate the second loan later, since double matched loans cannot be paid off. So the lender gets back the 100USD from the first loan after the lender pays it off, and then liquidates the second instance and claims 150USD of collateral, getting 100UDS (repayment) + 150 USD (liquidation). This can only happen if the borrower has opened multiple loan requests, and thus the contract must have the necessary funds for the liquidation.

This can be used to drain all collateral from the contract.

## Recommendation

Add a non-re-entrant modifier to `clearRequest`. Otherwise, read the `requests[reqID_]` from storage after the callback.
