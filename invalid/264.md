# The loan requestor does not get the collateral back after repaying.
## Summary
Anyone can make a loan request via `requestLoan`. However, when a loan is repaid, the collateral goes to the Cooler owner and not the loan requestor. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The  collateral is taken from the loan requestor, but after repaying the loan, the loan gets sent to the Cooler owner.
```solidity
function requestLoan(..){
        ...
        // The collateral is taken upfront. Will be escrowed
        // until the loan is repaid or defaulted.
        collateral().safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            collateralFor(amount_, loanToCollateral_)
        );
```

```solidity
function repayLoan(...){
     ....
     // Transfer repaid debt back to the lender and (de)collateral back to the owner.
     collateral().safeTransfer(owner(), decollateralized);
     ...
```

## Impact
User will not get their collateral back after repaying their loan.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
One option is to include the loan requestor address in the `Request` struct during `requestLoan` to ensure the collateral gets sent back to the actual requestor.
```solidity
collateral().safeTransfer(loan.request.requestor, decollateralized);
```
