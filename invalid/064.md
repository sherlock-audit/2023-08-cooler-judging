# `LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL` (DAI/gOHM) exchange rate may be stale
_This is similar issue which was submitted by `IllIllI` in last audit but it seems the recommendation is not incorporated. This report is referrenced from [this](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler-judging/issues/217) issue with updations per new code base._

## Summary
The `LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL` variable is a constant which implies a specific `DAI/gOHM` exchange rate. The exchange rate has already changed so the current value in use will be wrong, and any value chosen now will eventually be out of date.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL ` is hard-coded, rather than being based on an oracle price,

```Solidity
    uint256 public constant LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL = 3000e18;       // 3,000 DAI/gOHM
```
**It is to be noted here that this value was 2500e18 in previous audit of Clearinghouse.sol**

If the code had been using a Chainlink oracle, this issue would be equivalent to not checking whether the price used to determine the loan-to-collateral ratio was stale, which is a Medium-severity issue.

` LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL` is hardcoded and has been used in functions like [lendToCooler](https://github.com/ohmzeus/Cooler/blob/c6f2bbe1b51cdf3bb4d078875170177a1b8ba2a3/src/Clearinghouse.sol#L129-L152), [rollLoan](https://github.com/ohmzeus/Cooler/blob/c6f2bbe1b51cdf3bb4d078875170177a1b8ba2a3/src/Clearinghouse.sol#L165) and [debtForCollateral](https://github.com/ohmzeus/Cooler/blob/c6f2bbe1b51cdf3bb4d078875170177a1b8ba2a3/src/Clearinghouse.sol#L388)

**For example:**
While drafting this report, gOHM price is [$2500](https://coinmarketcap.com/dexscan/ethereum/0x5d66d2506cafad9204429c3918553f76950197f6/) and `LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL` = 3000e18 is already hardcoded in contract

If the gOHM price drops below $3000 which is already dropped to $2500, a loan for 3000 DAI will only require 1 gOHM of collateral, even though it should require at least 1.2 gOHM in order to be fully-collateralized.

## Impact
Under-collateralized loans will be given, and borrowers will purposely take loans default, since they can use the loan amount to buy more collateral than they would lose during default.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a chainlink oracle to determine the right prices to use when coming up with ` LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL` for each loan
