# `LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL` value is hardcoded and this is a problem
## Summary

In `Clearinghouse.sol` we have `LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL`which is hardcoded to `3000e18`:

```solidity
uint256 public constant LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL = 3000e18;       // 3,000 DAI/gOHM
```

This means every 1 gOHM used as collateral, you can get a loan of 3,000 DAI. But the real cost may be quite different. At the time of writing the report, the real price is 2900 DAI.

## Vulnerability Detail

`LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL` is an extremely important variable that is used in calculations when taking out a loan. 

```solidity
137: // Compute and access collateral. Increment loan receivables.
138: uint256 collateral = cooler_.collateralFor(amount_, LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL);
...
144: uint256 reqID = cooler_.requestLoan(amount_, INTEREST_RATE, LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL, DURATION);
...
165: cooler_.provideNewTermsForRoll(loanID_, INTEREST_RATE, LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL, DURATION);
...
388: uint256 loan = collateral_ * LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL / 1e18;
```
Now the value is hardcoded. This means that 1 gOHM is being valued at 3,000 DAI for the purposes of this loan mechanism. 

You can see in real-time the value can be different -> https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/governance-ohm/

This makes the contract and loan unusable. Because who would use the protocol if they have to pay a much higher price than the real one? On the other hand, if the price is less than the real one the protocol will be disadvantaged.

Even worse is that `LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL` is a constant and cannot be changed even manually by the admin.
## Impact

The value of `LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL` may be quite different from the actual value and this will stop users from using the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- One option is to use Oracle to take the value in real time.
- The other option is to change the value to not be a constant and create a function to manually settle the value
