# After repaying loan, collateral is sent to contract owner, rather than borrower
## Summary
After repaying loan, collateral is sent to contract owner, rather than borrower

## Vulnerability Detail
Upon repaying a loan, the collateral is sent to the contract owner instead of the borrower. Considering anyone can be a borrower, this possesses a huge flaw to the overall system.
```solidity

        // Transfer repaid debt back to the lender and (de)collateral back to the owner.
        debt().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, repayTo, repaid_);
        collateral().safeTransfer(owner(), decollateralized);
```

## Impact
Borrowers will lose their collateral even after repaying their loan.
