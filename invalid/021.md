# LendToCooler function works incorrectly. It just takes msg.sender's tokens and then gives themselves a loan.
## Summary

`lendToCooler` is supposed to allow any user to lend to the cooler created by the ClearingHouse with predefined terms.

Instead, it:

1. takes in DAI from user
2. requests a loan for the clearinghouse contract
3. takes their own loan also for the clearinghouse contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `lendToCooler()` function:

Loan is requested by clearinghouse:

```solidity
uint256 reqID = cooler_.requestLoan(amount_, INTEREST_RATE, LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL, DURATION);
```

ClearingHouse takes their own loan:

```solidity
uint256 loanID = cooler_.clearRequest(reqID, true, true);
```

This is circular logic. If you take your own loan you are paying interest to yourself and not actually borrowing any funds.

There is a test in Clearinghouse.t.sol that checks this function, which only passes because both the contracts and tests are incorrect. In the test, they have a USER that creates a valid factory which sets themselves as owner(). As the self-loan sends the tokens to the `owner`, the loan appears to be successful due to the DAI balance transfer. In a normal case, the lend requester is not the owner of the Cooler contract.


## Impact

- lendToCooler takes in user's DAI and then doesn't do what the function is supposed to do
-User that calls lendToCooler loses their collateral and cannot repay their loan because they never got paid the loan tokens in their first place.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

`lendToCooler` can take in a LoanID, which corresponds to a loan by the person who calls `lendToCooler` and then clear that request.
