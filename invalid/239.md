# Hardcoded `LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL` can become problematic
## Summary

Hardcoded `LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL` can lead to under collateralized loans in future.

## Vulnerability Detail

Currently in `ClearingHouse`, the value of `LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL` has been hardcoded as `3000e18`.

```solidity

55:   uint256 public constant LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL = 3000e18;       // 3,000 DAI/gOHM

```
[Link to Code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Clearinghouse.sol#L55)

As of now, the ratio of price of DAI and gOHM is ranging around 2900 and it has been on the upward trend since last one year. It has grown in value at a rate of 10% YoY as per coinmarketcap.

So there is a possibility that the actual price ratio can pass the hardcoded limit in few months. In this case, Under-collateralized Loans will be taken, and borrowers will intentionally accept these loans with the intention of defaulting, as they can utilize the loan funds to purchase additional collateral that outweighs potential losses from default.

## Impact

Giving of under collateralized loans can lead to loss of funds.

## Recommendation

I would suggest to not keep `LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL` variable constant and add a method to update it by the admin.
