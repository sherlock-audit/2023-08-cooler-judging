# Loss of Precision in interestFor Function in Cooler.sol
## Summary
The `Cooler.sol` smart contract contains a vulnerability that results in a loss of precision in the interestFor function. This vulnerability can lead to incorrect interest calculations when loans are taken in low decimal tokens such as `USDC`. The issue arises due to the usage of a constant with a fixed number of decimals in the interest calculation formula.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability stems from the inconsistency between the number of decimals used in the interestFor function and the constant `DECIMALS_INTEREST` declared in the Cooler.sol contract. The `DECIMALS_INTEREST` constant defines the number of decimals used in the contract, and it appears to be set to a fixed value of 6.

In line 56 of the `Cooler.sol` contract, the interestFor function is defined. This function calculates the interest for a loan based on the principal amount and the interest rate. However, the calculation does not take into account the decimal precision used by the token being borrowed, which can result in a loss of precision when dealing with low decimal tokens.
## Impact
This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to borrow loans with zero interest when using tokens with low decimal precision. Since the `interestFor` function may incorrectly return zero due to the loss of precision, an attacker could take advantage of this situation to borrow funds without having to pay any interest.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability and ensure accurate interest calculations, the following steps are recommended:

Dynamic Decimal Precision: Modify the `interestFor` function to dynamically determine the decimal precision of the token being borrowed. This can be achieved by fetching the token's decimal precision from its contract or by using a standard library for decimal arithmetic.
