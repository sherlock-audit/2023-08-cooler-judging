# Wrong Interest formula
## Summary
In the `clearRequest` function, lender is filing a loan position and the interest is being calculated using the `interestFor` function, and then this interest is being added to the Loan array, but if we see carefully then while making the request of Loan in `requestLoan` function, the borrower is inputting the amount of `interest` manually, and in the `clearRequest` function the interest is being calculated using the pre-determined formula, which will cause discrepancy  

## Vulnerability Detail
In the Cooler contract, there is a discrepancy between how interest is calculated in the requestLoan and clearRequest functions.

In the requestLoan function, the borrower manually specifies the interest amount as one of the parameters when requesting a loan. This allows the borrower to set the interest according to their preference.

However, in the clearRequest function, when a lender clears a loan request, the interest is calculated using the interestFor function based on the loan amount, interest rate, and loan duration provided in the original request. This means that the lender has no control over the interest amount and is subject to the interest calculation formula defined in the loan request.

## Impact
This discrepancy in how interest is determined could lead to unexpected outcomes. Borrowers may initially specify one interest rate when requesting a loan but lenders might end up with a different interest rate calculated based on the original loan terms.
