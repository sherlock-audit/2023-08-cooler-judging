# EmergencyShutdown doesn't actually shutdown or deactivate the ClearingHouse contract.
## Summary

EmergencyShutdown doesn't actually shutdown or deactivate the ClearingHouse contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

`emergencyShutdown` just defund's DAI and sets `active` to false:

```solidity
   function emergencyShutdown() external onlyRole("emergency_shutdown") {
        active = false;

        // If necessary, defund sDAI.
        uint256 sdaiBalance = sdai.balanceOf(address(this));
        if (sdaiBalance != 0) defund(sdai, sdaiBalance);

        // If necessary, defund DAI.
        uint256 daiBalance = dai.balanceOf(address(this));
        if (daiBalance != 0) defund(dai, daiBalance);

        emit Deactivated();
    }
```

It doesn't deactivate the contract. All the functions in the contract can still be called.

There needs to be an `isActive` check or modifier in all the relevant functions of the contract

## Impact

EmergencyShutdown doesn't shut down the contract

## Recommendation

Add a check that `active == true` for all important functions in ClearingHouse
