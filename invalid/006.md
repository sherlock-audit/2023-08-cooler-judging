# Different ERC20s will cause issues, contrary to the protocol's intentions
## Summary
The developer team is intending to use the protocol for internal uses, but it allows p2p interactions and multiple ERC20 tokens, not specified in the contest page, some of which can cause issues.

## Vulnerability Detail
All kinds of ERC20 tokens are allowed, thus I will summarize this issue:
FEE-ON-TRANSFER: Contest page says they won't be used, the contracts fully allow it, thus some collateral may not be transferred, repay attempts might fail due to dust amounts missing because of the fees, borrower gets less tokens, etc, etc.
Pausable tokens: Could brick repayment of loans, ultimately leading to defaulting of a loan.
0 transfer tokens: The most common example USDT might revert transaction in some cases, even though unlikely.
Different decimal tokens: wrong collateral amount calculations due to ``collateralFor()`` not bringing the token decimals to 18 to match the denominator which is 1e18.
Blocklist tokens: Certain tokens with blacklisted addresses would not allow certain people to be either borrowers, nor lenders. 

## Impact
Different kinds of losses, either through wasted gas on reverting transactions, losing collateral due to defaulting or losing portions of collateral or debt due to fees

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Create a token whitelist and use the common precautions against these token types, such as checking the provided amounts against 0 to prevent 0 transfers, checking the token balance before and after transfers, but most importantly, whitelisting token addresses to prevent users from using arbitrary weird ERC20s.
