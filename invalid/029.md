# Various low issues
## Summary

Low issues found collected here. Setting label to "Medium" because Sherlock removed "Low" from the label list.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. In `Clearinghouse.rebalance`, the `sdai.approve` call is erroneous because function uses transfer instead of transferFrom. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Clearinghouse.sol#L318

2. After reactivating, the Clearinghouse may have to wait up to 7 days before it can resume making loans.

3. Having a hardcoded ratio of 3000 DAI/gOhm is very dangerous, especially because gOhm currently trades at under 3000 DAI.

4. ~~Having the debt of the Clearinghouse denominated in DAI seems  bad because the sDAI/DAI  ratio can change.~~ Okay, this might be fine. It just means that the Clearinghouse is taking a position in sDAI vs. DAI, so that the value paid back will be different from the value withdrawn. However, the Treasury is holding sDAI for positions reported in DAI, which means its own reserve numbers may be incorrect.

5. Clearinghouse.claimDefaulted checks neither the lender nor the currency. So it's possible for some to make up a new coin, mint themselves 2**255 tokens in exchange for 0.0000000001 gOhm, lend all the token to themselves, default on the loan, and then call Clearinghouse.claimDefaulted. Doing so, then they can drive the debt of the Clearinghouse to 0. I have found no on-chain consequences to this number being wrong, even after looking through the Olympus code.

6. totalInterest is calculated incorrectly in Clearinghouse.claimDefaulted. It appears the goal is to try to compute the original amount lent, before interest. But, for a loan that has not been rolled over, it actually computes (original amount lended + original interest) * interest rate, getting a number which is too high. If  the loan has been rolled over, then it's even more wrong.  I have found no on-chain consequences to this number being wrong, even after looking through the Olympus code.

7. A consequence of the previous point: `totalDebt` in `Clearinghouse.claimDefaulted` actually can overflow. So can totalInterest.

8. Should provide a way to change isCallback when changing ownership.

9. `Cooler.isDefaulted` should probably be renamed to `hasExpired`.

10. The contract allows delegating gOhm governance, but I saw discussion on the Olympus forums saying that people who take Cooler loans should lose their votes.

11. `receivables` can be set to 0 by creating a sufficiently big `totalDebt` using custom tokens in your own cooler and then calling `Clearinghouse.claimDefaulted` as shown in other issues.
