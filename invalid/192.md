# Incorrect token count in Clearinghouse.lendToCooler() when using a token with a transfer fee
## Summary

There are ERC20 format tokens that, when transferred, charge a commission when transferring from address to address. For example: https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#fee-on-transfer. If such a token is used as collateral, the number of receivables will be incorrectly calculated (https://github.com/ohmzeus/Cooler/blob/c6f2bbe1b51cdf3bb4d078875170177a1b8ba2a3/src/Clearinghouse.sol#L139C9-L139C54). This will lead to incorrect accounting of tokens in the future and at some point to the absence of this token at the contract address.

For example:
The token has a transfer fee of 1%. The user transfers 1000 tokens to the contract address (https://github.com/ohmzeus/Cooler/blob/c6f2bbe1b51cdf3bb4d078875170177a1b8ba2a3/src/Clearinghouse.sol#L144). In fact, 1000 - 1% = 990 tokens are sent to the contract address. In turn, receivables += debtForCollateral(collateral) is calculated based on the number of tokens = 1000.

## Recommendation

Use the difference in the number of tokens at the contract address before and after the receipt of tokens
