# lender may not able to claim debt token in case of USDC
## Summary
lender may not able to claim debt token in case of USDC 

## Vulnerability Detail
## Impact

This issue has been arised by referrening the issue in previous audit [Lender force Loan become default](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler-judging/issues/23). After the understanding the issue, the protocol team has implemented the below solution to claim the usdc debt tokens if the lender is blocklisted.

```Solidity
File: src/Cooler.sol

    function claimRepaid(uint256 loanID_) external {
        Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];

        // Update storage.
        uint256 claim = loan.unclaimed;
        delete loans[loanID_].unclaimed;

        // Transfer repaid debt back to the lender.
>>       debt().safeTransfer(loan.lender, claim);
    }
```

The above function only works when repayDirect is false,

```Solidity
File: src/Cooler.sol

    function repayLoan(uint256 loanID_, uint256 repaid_) external returns (uint256) {


    // some code


        address repayTo;
        // Check whether repayment needs to be manually claimed or not.
>>      if (loan.repayDirect) {
            repayTo = loan.lender;
        } else {
            repayTo = address(this);
            loan.unclaimed += repaid_;
        }

        // Save updated loan info in storage.
        loans[loanID_] = loan;

        // Transfer repaid debt back to the lender and (de)collateral back to the owner.
        debt().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, repayTo, repaid_);


    // some code

    }
```

In above function if the `if` condition is `false` the debt tokens are transferred to `address(this)` i.e contract address itself. As we are considering the case of USDC [here](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#tokens-with-blocklists) for debt tokens which has blocklisted feature. 

If the lender is blocklisted then usdc can not be transferred and in `claimRepaid()` as seen at L-312 it is directly set as `loan.lender` which the blocklisted address wont be able to receive the debt token.

```Solidity
        debt().safeTransfer(loan.lender, claim);
```

To mitigate the issue, it is recommended to allow the recipient address and the `claimRepaid()` should have access control. It is to be noted here the recipient address can also be lender own address or the address he want to transfer debt tokens. In either case, this works and resolves this issue.

-    function claimRepaid(uint256 loanID_) external {
+    function claimRepaid(uint256 loanID_, address recipient) external {
        Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];

+      if (msg.sender != loan.lender) revert OnlyApproved();

        // Update storage.
        uint256 claim = loan.unclaimed;
        delete loans[loanID_].unclaimed;

        // Transfer repaid debt back to the lender.
-       debt().safeTransfer(loan.lender, claim);
+       debt().safeTransfer(recipient, claim);
    }
