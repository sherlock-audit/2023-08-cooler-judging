# Clearinghouse.sol#claimDefaulted - If Olympus's MINTR goes inactive, `claimDefault` will brick, effectively not allowing any loan to be defaulted
## Summary
If Olympus's MINTR goes inactive, `claimDefault` will brick, effectively not allowing any loan to be defaulted,

## Vulnerability Detail
[Olympus V3 MINTR](https://docs.olympusdao.finance/main/technical/contract-docs/modules/MINTR/OlympusMinter#active) has a variable called `active`. If this is set to false `burnOhm` will revert as it uses [onlyWhileActive modifier](https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-v3/blob/19236eb1c02464df8fb79c7b59b7195d7511b338/src/modules/MINTR/MINTR.v1.sol#L35-L38) which reverts the tx if `active` is false.

Since `MINTR.burnOhm` reverts, no loan can be defaulted.

The likelihood of this scenario occurring is small, so I consider it a Medium.

## Impact
Bricking of the entire `claimDefault` function, effectively not punishing borrowers if they don't pay their loan in time.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Wrap the entire function in a `try/catch` block and handle the revert from the `MINTR`.
