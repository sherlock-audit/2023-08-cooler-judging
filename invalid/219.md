# Lender can set anyone to be the new lender
## Summary

Anyone can become the new loan lender, even the borrower

## Vulnerability Detail

The lender can set a new address to be the lender of the loan. What will the old lender get or will just lose the loan amount? Also, what if the borrower of the loan is determined to be a lender, he will receive both the loan amount and the collateral after the loan defaults.

## Impact

Lender will lose the provided amount to the protocol.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function approveTransfer(address to_, uint256 loanID_) external {
    if (msg.sender != loans[loanID_].lender) revert OnlyApproved();

    // Update transfer approvals.
    approvals[loanID_] = to_;
}
```

```solidity
function transferOwnership(uint256 loanID_) external {
    if (msg.sender != approvals[loanID_]) revert OnlyApproved();

    // Update the load lender.
    loans[loanID_].lender = msg.sender;
    // Clear transfer approvals.
    approvals[loanID_] = address(0);
}
```

Restrict who can become a loan lender, and also give compensation to the old lender.
