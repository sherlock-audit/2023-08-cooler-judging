# [M-03] If a borrower or lender got blacklisted by asset contract, their collateral or loan funds can be permanently frozen in the contract.
## Summary

It's impossible for borrower or lender to transfer their otherwise withdraw-able funds to another address. If for some reason borrower or lender got blacklisted by collateral or debt token contract (correspondingly), these funds will be permanently frozen as now there is no mechanics to move them to another address or specify the recipient for the transfer.

## Vulnerability Detail

If during the duration of a loan the borrower or lender got blacklisted by collateral/debt token contract, let's say it is USDC, there is no way to retrieve the collateral. These collateral funds will be permanently locked at the Pool contract balance.

This happens in multiple functions across the [Cooler.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/6d34cd12a2a15d2c92307d44782d6eae1474ab25/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol) such as [Cooler: :rollLoan()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/6d34cd12a2a15d2c92307d44782d6eae1474ab25/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol#L211C9-L217C6) or [Cooler: :clearRequest()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/6d34cd12a2a15d2c92307d44782d6eae1474ab25/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol#L270C8-L271C66) etc... There is no option to specify the address receiving the collateral asset.


## Impact

Principal funds of borrower or lender can be permanently frozen in full, but blacklisting is a low probability event, so setting the severity to be medium.

## Code Snippet

```javascript
//Cooler: :rollLoan()
         if (newCollateral > 0) {
            collateral().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newCollateral);
        }

        // If necessary, trigger lender callback.
        if (loan.callback) CoolerCallback(loan.lender).onRoll(loanID_, newDebt, newCollateral);
    }
```
```javascript
//Cooler: :claimRepaid()
        // Transfer repaid debt back to the lender.
        debt().safeTransfer(loan.lender, claim);
```
```javascript
//Cooler: :claimDefaulted()
        // Transfer defaulted collateral to the lender.
        collateral().safeTransfer(loan.lender, loan.collateral);
```
```javascript
//Cooler: :rescindRequest()
        // Update storage and send collateral back to the owner.
        req.active = false;
        collateral().safeTransfer(owner(), collateralFor(req.amount, req.loanToCollateral));
```
```javascript
//Cooler: :repayLoan()
        // Transfer repaid debt back to the lender and (de)collateral back to the owner.
        debt().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, repayTo, repaid_);
        collateral().safeTransfer(owner(), decollateralized); //collateral is returned back to owner
```
```javascript
//Cooler: :clearRequest()
        // Transfer debt tokens to the owner of the request.
        debt().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, owner(), req.amount);
```
```javascript
//Cooler: :rollLoan()
        if (newCollateral > 0) {
            collateral().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newCollateral);
        }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding the `recipient` argument to the affected functions, so the balance beneficiary msg.sender can specify what address should receive the funds.

Also add checks like 
```javascript
if (msg.sender != owner()) revert OnlyApproved();
```
and
```javascript
if (msg.sender != loan.lender) revert OnlyApproved();
```
wherever necessary to ensure access control
