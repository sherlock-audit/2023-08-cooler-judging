# If the user sets duration to be shorter than the generation time of a block, it may cause the borrower fail to repay the loan, and can only get debt token and lose the collateral directly
## Summary

Assume the following scenario:

When the network liquidity is low, the block generation time may be extended and unstable. If the user sets `duration` to be shorter than the generation time of a block, it may cause the lender to issue a loan Then issue an instruction to withdraw the collateral. These two requests may be packaged in the same block, causing the borrower to fail to repay the loan, and can only get `debt token` and lose the collateral directly

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    function requestLoan(
        uint256 amount_,
        uint256 interest_,
        uint256 loanToCollateral_,
        uint256 duration_
    ) external returns (uint256 reqID) {
        reqID = requests.length;
        requests.push(
            Request({
                amount: amount_,
                interest: interest_,
                loanToCollateral: loanToCollateral_,
                duration: duration_,//@audit
                active: true
            })
        );

        // The collateral is taken upfront. Will be escrowed
        // until the loan is repaid or defaulted.
        collateral().safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            collateralFor(amount_, loanToCollateral_)
        );

        // Log the event.
        factory().newEvent(reqID, CoolerFactory.Events.RequestLoan, 0);
    }
```
## Impact

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We can set a parameter like `block_number` when using `requestLoan` ,and check `block.number > block_number` when the lender claims collateral
