# Cooler.sol - collateral may get sent to the wrong refund recipient
## Summary
In ``Cooler.sol`` repaying a loan and rescinding a borrow request both send back the collateral that was escrowed, or part of it. The problem is that in some use cases, this collateral gets sent to the wrong address.

## Vulnerability Detail
As per the intentions of the developers to integrate this contract with Olympus to work specifically with DAI/gOHM through their ``ClearingHouse.sol``, the owner of the Cooler would be the borrower in question and the Olympus Treasury would be providing the DAI loans. Thus, in the Cooler implementation contract, any instance of repaying back a loan or rescinding a loan sends back the collateral to the ``owner()``, a.k.a DAI borrower.
The problem arises from the fact that Cooler can be generated and used independently from the ClearingHouse as a means to lend and borrow different kinds of ERC20 tokens. This means that any loan repayment or request rescinding would mean the collateral that is supposed to be refunded gets sent to the Cooler instance's owner instead, either creating extra work for the refund or straight up collateral stealing.

## Impact
Loss of collateral or generation of extra manual work for refunding collateral, outside of the Olympus ecosystem

Manual Review

## Recommendation
As per 1 of my other issues, a good solution and a recommended design choice in general would be to add a ``requester`` parameter to the ``Request`` struct or make sure only the owner of the Cooler can request Borrows, which I would avoid since it would kill the p2p   idea.
