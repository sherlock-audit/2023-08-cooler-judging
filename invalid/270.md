# Lender can take abuse of the repay direct option.
## Summary
Lender can take abuse of the repay direct option.
## Vulnerability Detail
Cooler contract let lender to set direct repay when fills the requested loan. even if lender doesn't do it when fills the request, there is other function let lender to set direct repay after fills the request.
```solidity
function setDirectRepay(uint256 loanID_, bool direct_) external {
        if (msg.sender != loans[loanID_].lender) revert OnlyApproved();

        // Update the repayment method.
        loans[loanID_].repayDirect = direct_;
    }
```
imagine debt tokens have a blacklist like USDC/USDT. now lender can blacklist their own address and DoS the repay action for borrowers. As a result, borrower can't repay the loan and liquidates and loses their collateral.

## Impact
Borrower can't repay loan and lose the collateral.

## Code Snippet
```solidity 
function setDirectRepay(uint256 loanID_, bool direct_) external {
        if (msg.sender != loans[loanID_].lender) revert OnlyApproved();

        // Update the repayment method.
        loans[loanID_].repayDirect = direct_;
    }
```
and

```solidity 
function clearRequest(
        uint256 reqID_,
        bool repayDirect_,
        bool isCallback_
    ) external returns (uint256 loanID) {
        Request memory req = requests[reqID_];

        // If necessary, ensure lender implements the CoolerCallback abstract.
        if (isCallback_ && !CoolerCallback(msg.sender).isCoolerCallback()) revert NotCoolerCallback();

        // Ensure loan request is active. 
        if (!req.active) revert Deactivated();

        // Clear the loan request in memory.
        req.active = false;

        // Calculate and store loan terms.
        uint256 interest = interestFor(req.amount, req.interest, req.duration);
        uint256 collat = collateralFor(req.amount, req.loanToCollateral);
        uint256 expiration = block.timestamp + req.duration;
        loanID = loans.length;
        loans.push(
            Loan({
                request: req,
                amount: req.amount + interest,
                unclaimed: 0,
                collateral: collat,
                expiry: expiration,
                lender: msg.sender,
                repayDirect: repayDirect_,
                callback: isCallback_
            })
        );

        // Clear the loan request storage.
        requests[reqID_].active = false;

        // Transfer debt tokens to the owner of the request.
        debt().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, owner(), req.amount);

        // Log the event.
        factory().newEvent(reqID_, CoolerFactory.Events.ClearRequest, 0);
    }

## Recommendation
Consider avoiding direct transfer.
