# Malicious organization can wipe out the treasury of Cooler from it's treasure
## Summary
The ```ClaimDefaulted()``` function under ```Clearinghouse.sol```  allows anyone to claim defaulted on the clearinghouse's behalf. Keepers get a small reward as incentive. No token are returned from the burn. That means the treasury loses money each time someone defaults. 
## Vulnerability Detail
Organisation ```X``` finds that Cooler is a strong competitor and decides to scarifice 0.5% of their treasury to send Cooler to hell within 1 year, because remeber  Cooler's interest rate is 0.5% annually . 
```X```  get's enough gOHM ```(6000)``` + interest  to borrow maximum treasury  ```( 18 million DAI )``` , and do not repay back .  ```X``` waits untill his loan get's defaulted and call ```ClaimDefaulted()``` function under ```Clearinghouse.sol``` to clainDefaulted for his defaulted loans . This result in Cooler burning the collateral, sending him a small reward as keeperRewards and losing all the treasury funds.
## Impact
The impact is more than high, it's critical for Cooler survivals . All the treasury that is always capped at 18millions DAI can be wipped out by someone who have enough gOHM to do so .

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Convert the collateral back to dai and send it back to the treasury if a borrower default on his loan instead of burning them . It does not make sense in real life to dump a borrower collateral if he does not repay you back .
