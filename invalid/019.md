# RepayLoan transfers funds to owner() not loan-taker when repay
## Summary

repayLoan transferss funds to the owner(), rather than returning the collateral to the borrower

## Vulnerability Detail

`repayLoan()` should send tokens to the lender. Instead they are set to the owner(). The owner() function returns the first 20 bytes of the calldata when creating this contract.

We see here that the contract:

1. transfers tokens from msg.sender to either this contract or the lender, thus repaying the loan
2. Transfers collateral to owner()

```solidity
debt().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, repayTo, repaid_);
collateral().safeTransfer(owner(), decollateralized);
```

## Impact
- Funds are transferred to wrong address
- Borrower does not get their collateral back

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Store the `borrower` in the Loan struct, and change this line

```solidity
collateral().safeTransfer(owner(), decollateralized);
```

to this

```solidity
debt().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, repayTo, repaid_);
collateral().safeTransfer(loan.borrower, decollateralized);
```
