# A borrower cannot cancel their request, unless they are the contract owner
## Summary
Any user can create a borrow request. However, only the owner of the contract can cancel them.

## Vulnerability Detail
Any user can create a borrow request. Upon creating one, collateral is deposited into the contract. In the case where the request is not accepted by any lender, unless the borrower is the contract owner, they cannot withdraw their collateral back and it is forever stuck in the contract, due to the unnecessary access control in `rescindRequest`
```solidity
    function rescindRequest(uint256 reqID_) external {
        if (msg.sender != owner()) revert OnlyApproved();
```

## Impact
Borrower's funds may be forever stuck
