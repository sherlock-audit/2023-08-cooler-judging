# `Clearinghouse` is giving away undercollateralized loans because of constant rate
## Summary
All the loans created by `Clearinghouse` have a fixed rate of `3,000 DAI/gOHM` which is less than the current price (~$2900 as of August 2023). Hence, `Clearinghouse` is giving away money!

## Vulnerability Detail
The `LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL` rate is hardcoded as a `constant` to `3000e18` in the `Clearinghouse` contract. This means that all the loans created by `Clearinghouse` have a rate of `3,000 DAI/gOHM`

```solidity
File Clearinghouse.sol

L55: uint256 public constant LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL = 3000e18;       // 3,000 DAI/gOHM
```
### Proof of Concept
This test that can be added to `Clearing.t.sol` shows how requesting 3000 DAI (worth $3000) requires only 1e18 gOHM (worth ~$2900 at time of writing).

```solidity
function test_BUG_undercollateralized_loan() public {
    uint256 loanAmount_ = 3000e18;
    // Requesting a loan of 3000e18 DAI
    (Cooler cooler, uint256 gohmNeeded, uint256 loanID) = _createLoanForUser(loanAmount_);

    // 1e18 gOHM were sent as collateral
    assertEq(gohm.balanceOf(address(cooler)), 1e18);
    assertEq(dai.balanceOf(address(user)), 3000e18);

    console.log("Cooler has", gohm.balanceOf(address(cooler)), "gOHM"); // Cooler has 1000000000000000000 gOHM
    console.log("User has  ", dai.balanceOf(address(user)), "DAI");     // User has   3000000000000000000000 DAI       
}
```

## Impact
`Clearinghouse` is giving away undercollateralized loans as soon as the price of `gOHM` goes bellow `$3000`.
So, if the price of `gOHM` goes below `$3000` (which is currently the case) the treasury can be drained (up to `FUND_AMOUNT`, i.e. 18 million) by requesting undercollateralized loans.

The protocol can be drained in on transaction by leveraging a flashloan:
1. Attacker takes a flashloan of gOHM
2. Attacker takes a loan of `FUND_AMOUNT` (18 million DAI)
3. Attacker sells the DAI for gOHM
4. Attacker reimburses the flashloan and takes the profit

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL` should not be a constant and should be updatable by the governance.
