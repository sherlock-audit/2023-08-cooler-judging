# Overflow Error from divide by 0
## Summary
Possible Error from Overflow Error Due to Arithmetic  Calculation from the divide by possible 0
## Vulnerability Detail

On generating the decollateralized variable, loan.amount is correctly used to get the collateralized value but there is an instance where a user could put a loan request amount as zero, which could cause a revert here as it'll always revert due to overflow

## Impact
DOS attack which could cause inconsistent record keeping
## Code Snippet

```solidity
Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];

        if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) revert Default();

        if (repaid_ > loan.amount) repaid_ = loan.amount;

        uint256 decollateralized = (loan.collateral * repaid_) / loan.amount;
        if (decollateralized == 0) revert ZeroCollateralReturned();

        // Update loan memory.
        loan.amount -= repaid_;
        loan.collateral -= decollateralized;
```
