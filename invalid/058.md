# Possibility of obtaining borrows providing 0 collateral
## Summary
Borrowers have the ability to input a significantly high value for **`loanToCollateral_`** when utilizing the **`requestLoan()`** function. This can lead to a situation where the calculated collateral value, as determined by the **`collateralFor()`** becomes 0.
## Vulnerability Detail
The processing of borrower requests is managed by the **`Cooler.sol`** contract.
The **`requestLoan()`** has a **`loanToCollateral_`** input that indicates how much tokens debt the borrower will recieve for a collateral unit provided.
```solidity
function requestLoan(uint256 amount_, uint256 interest_, uint256 loanToCollateral_, uint256 duration_) external returns (uint256 reqID) {...}
```
To determine the required amount of tokens that a borrower must use as collateral, the **`collateralFor()`** employs the **`loanToCollateral_`** ratio.
```solidity
function collateralFor(uint256 amount_, uint256 loanToCollateral_) public view returns (uint256) {
        return (amount_ * (10 ** collateral().decimals())) / loanToCollateral_;
    }
```
If a malicious borrower input an excessively high value for **`loanToCollateral_`**, the outcome will lead to a collateral requirement of 0.
## Example
Let's consider the scenario:
-Bob intends to borrow 1000 debt tokens, thus entering **`amount_ = 1000`** and **`loanToCollateral_ = 1000000000e18`**.
-Through the **`collateralFor()`** calculation, the required collateral tokens for Bob are determined: **`(1000 * e18)/1000000000e18`**. This computation yields a value of 0.
-Alice approves it. As a result, Alice transfers 1000 debt tokens to Bob. However, Bob contributes 0 collateral tokens.
## Impact
Lenders face the risk of losing their funds when they are unable to reclaim the collateral in cases where borrowers fail to make their required payments.
## POC
```solidity
uint256 public constant LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL = 100000000000000 * 1e18;
uint256 public constant LOAN_AMOUNT = 1000;

function testRequestWithCollateral0() public {
        
        // test inputs
        uint256 amount_ = bound(LOAN_AMOUNT, 0, MAX_DEBT);
        bool directRepay = true;
        bool callbackRepay = false;
        // test setup
        cooler = _initCooler();
        (uint256 reqID, ) = _requestLoan(amount_); //LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL = 100000000000000 * 1e18 VERY BIG RATIO

        vm.startPrank(lender);
        // aprove debt so that it can be transferred by cooler
        debt.approve(address(cooler), amount_);
        cooler.clearRequest(reqID, directRepay, callbackRepay);
        vm.stopPrank();

        uint256 Contract_balance = collateral.balanceOf(address(cooler));
        uint256 User_balance = debt.balanceOf(owner);

        assertEq(Contract_balance,0);
        assertEq(User_balance, LOAN_AMOUNT);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure the utilization of a maximum **`loanToCollateral_`** ratio or implement checks to guarantee that the collateral remains above zero.
