# Transfer/transferFrom ERC20 return values are not checked

## Impact

Some tokens (such as USDT) do not correctly implement the EIP20 standard and their transfer/ transferFrom functions return void instead of a success boolean. Calling these functions with the correct EIP20 function signatures will always return.

Tokens that do not correctly implement the latest EIP20 specification, such as USDT, will be unusable in the protocol as they will cancel the transaction due to the lack of a return value.

I recommend using SafeERC20 versions of OpenZeppelin with safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom functions that handle return value checking, as well as non-standard tokens.
