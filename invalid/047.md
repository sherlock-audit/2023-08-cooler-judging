# Anyone can request a loan from cooler, which could lead to his collateral funds loss.
## Summary
In Cooler.sol the requestLoan function could be called by anyone and his collateral tokens would be sent to the cooler. Later if the owner of the cooler contract decide to rescind the request, the collateral token are being sent the owner. Other scenario, if a lender close the request, the loan token is again sent to the owner of the cooler for free, because of the regular user collateral payer.
## Vulnerability Detail
The contract functions are designed to be secure if they are called only from the cleaninghouse.sol contract, but following the docs, the update aims to provide any asset p2p lending/borrowing logic. This is why Cooler.sol should be designed to also have that in mind. Currently anyone is able to create Cooler for any ERC20 and anyone could request a loan from it for the creator of the cooler. Also anyone could close the request in the same transaction, before the cooler owner rescind it. This is a business logic leak, because the contract is unstable and could lead to malicious owner taking advantage of it.

## Impact
Regular user collateral funds lose.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use some modifiers of who can request a loan from a cooler, if the main logic is `cooler owner is always == borrower == collateral payer`, else if this is not the main logic, you can store the borrower in the Request struct and use his address to repay the collateral and sent the debt tokens.
