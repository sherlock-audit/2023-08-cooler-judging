# Hardcoded `LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL` makes borrowing profitable.
## Summary

Hardcoded `LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL` makes borrowing profitable.

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract `ClearingHouse.sol` defines the variable `LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL` as a hardcoded constant value. The issue is that the price of gOHM can change and this might be giving out loans and bad prices, making it profitable for the borrowers to just take loans and then never repay them.

The current value of `LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL` is set to `3000e18`, meaning 3000 DAI can be borrowed against 1 gOHM. The current price of gOHM is already below 300 USD, meaning anyone can just take a 3000 DAI loan against 1 gOHM and then never repay it, and sell of the DAI for profit. This is because the loan is worth more than the collateral.

## Impact

Attackers can drain the protocol by arbitraging the price difference.

## Recommendation

Instead of having a hardcoded value for `LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL`, have it as an oracle dependent value. This way the contract can make sure it is collateralized when giving out loans.
