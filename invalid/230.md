# User can force loan to go into default by joining debt token's blacklist
## Summary
By joining debt token's blacklist, the user can block all loan repayments and force the loan to go into default.

## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens, such as USDC and USDT, have blocklist mechanisms.. If the debt token used is USDC/ USDT and `loan.repayDirect == true`, all borrow repayments will be sent directly to the loan lender. If they manage to join the token's blacklist, this will force all repayments to revert and user will unable to repay back their loan and it will go into default. Loan lender will then be able to successfully withdraw the innocent user's collateral..
```solidity
        if (loan.repayDirect) {
            repayTo = loan.lender;
        } else {
            repayTo = address(this);
            loan.unclaimed += repaid_;
        }
```

```solidity
       debt().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, repayTo, repaid_);
``` 
Note: this could also happen by transferring the loan ownership to a blacklisted address using the `transferOwnership` function 
```solidity
    function transferOwnership(uint256 loanID_) external {
        if (msg.sender != approvals[loanID_]) revert OnlyApproved();

        // Update the load lender.
        loans[loanID_].lender = msg.sender;
        // Clear transfer approvals.
        approvals[loanID_] = address(0);
    }
```

## Impact
User can force loan to go into default and steal collateral.
