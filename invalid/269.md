        uint256 amount_,
        uint256 interest_,
        uint256 loanToCollateral_,
        uint256 duration_
    ) external returns (uint256 reqID) {
        reqID = requests.length;
        requests.push(

                active: true
            })
        );

        // The collateral is taken upfront. Will be escrowed
        // until the loan is repaid or defaulted.
        collateral().safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            collateralFor(amount_, loanToCollateral_)
        );

        // Log the event.
        factory().newEvent(reqID, CoolerFactory.Events.RequestLoan, 0);

Save requester info into Request struct or Event mesage.

requests.push(
    Request({
        amount: amount_,
        interest: interest_,
        loanToCollateral: loanToCollateral_,
        duration: duration_,
        active: true
    })
);

factory().newEvent(reqID, CoolerFactory.Events.RequestLoan, 0);
