# Event Based Reentrancy
## Summary
Several functions susceptible to event based reentrancy

## Vulnerability Detail
Callback or hooks tokens such as ERC 223, ERC1363, ERC667 and ERC777 can callback into the functions before the event for the first call has been emitted, implying this event is missed. This occurs if the transfers occur before the emission of the event. 
See the various code snippets below. 

[Consider the example in function requestLoan() using a collateral token that has callbacks. When the transfer occurs from line 117 the contract receiving tokens can callback to request a long again with different id, the event emitted finally at line 124 will be for latest requestID and miss the first id details](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol#L98) 

This reentrancy only affects the accuracy of event details being emitted. 

## Impact
Event based reentrancy distorts offchain reporting by missing some of the event details which can be detrimental to front ends, off chain tooling, offchain reporting, event monitoring, and worst security monitoring that may be dependant on event emissions. 

## Code Snippet
```solidity
//Cooler.sol lines 117 -124
  collateral().safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            collateralFor(amount_, loanToCollateral_)
        );

        // Log the event.
        factory().newEvent(reqID, CoolerFactory.Events.RequestLoan, 0);

//Cooler.sol lines 138-141
collateral().safeTransfer(owner(), collateralFor(req.amount, req.loanToCollateral));

// Log the event.
factory().newEvent(reqID_, CoolerFactory.Events.RescindRequest, 0);

// Cooler.sol  lines 179-182 
 collateral().safeTransfer(owner(), decollateralized);

// Log the event.
factory().newEvent(loanID_, CoolerFactory.Events.RepayLoan, repaid_);

// Cooler.sol lines 271 - 275 
debt().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, owner(), req.amount);

// Log the event.
factory().newEvent(reqID_, CoolerFactory.Events.ClearRequest, 0);

// Cooler.sol lines 325 -328 
        collateral().safeTransfer(loan.lender, loan.collateral);

        // Log the event.
        factory().newEvent(loanID_, CoolerFactory.Events.DefaultLoan, 0);

```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to emit events before the various external safeTransfer() calls e.g
```solidity 
        // Log the event first.
        factory().newEvent(reqID, CoolerFactory.Events.RequestLoan, 0);
      
   // Then transfer tokens 
  collateral().safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            collateralFor(amount_, loanToCollateral_)
        );


```
