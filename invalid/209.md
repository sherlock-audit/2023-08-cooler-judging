# `Cooler.repayLoan` would revert in the case of blacklisted lender and would loss collateral
## Summary

`repayLoan(loanID, repaid_)` is used to repay a loan and get the collateral back. But if `repayDirect` is true and `loan.lender` is blacklisted  repayment will fail.

## Vulnerability Detail

`Alice` made a borrow request for a `token A`[having blacklisted features like USDC] and some lender  clears this request by `clearRequest`. Now whenever before `loan.expiry` `Alice ` tryies to repay her debt  tx will revert if lender is blacklisted by dept token.

```solidity
 function repayLoan(uint256 loanID_, uint256 repaid_) external returns (uint256) {
        Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];

        if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) revert Default();

        if (repaid_ > loan.amount) repaid_ = loan.amount;

       [................]
        address repayTo;
        // Check whether repayment needs to be manually claimed or not.
        if (loan.repayDirect) {
            repayTo = loan.lender;//@audit-info if repayDirect is true then repayTo will be lender address 
        } else {
            repayTo = address(this);
            loan.unclaimed += repaid_;
        }
[........................]

        // Transfer repaid debt back to the lender and (de)collateral back to the owner.
        debt().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, repayTo, repaid_); //@audit-issue will revert if repayTo(lender address) is blacklisted
        collateral().safeTransfer(owner(), decollateralized);

[.......................]

    
    }
```

Malicious lender will wait till loan.expiry and then withdraw all the collaterals deposited by Alice

Similar issue was submitted in previous sherlock contest of Cooler but it has very critical impact as lender can always change his address by  [1 ]( https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol#L338) and [2]( https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol#L347)

## Impact

user will loss all the collateral since repayment won't work

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Design a clear pattern where blacklisted address can be handled properly or repay always to `address(this)` contract address and then lender will be able to withdraw it.
