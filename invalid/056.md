# SweepIntoDSR does not sweep DAI into Vault
## Summary

SweepIntoDSR deposits DAI into `address(this)` rather than a "DSR Vault"

## Vulnerability Detail

This function doesn't actually sweep excess DAI into a vault like the function says:

```solidity
    /// @notice Sweep excess DAI into vault.
    function _sweepIntoDSR(uint256 amount_) internal {
        dai.approve(address(sdai), amount_);
        sdai.deposit(amount_, address(this));
    }
```

We can see from the deposit function, that it just transfers the tokens to `address(this)`, which is where the tokens initially started. This does not match the function's intended purpose, which is to deposit the tokens into a vault, presumably an ERC4626 vault shown by the import of that vault.
 
Also this contract is not ERC4626 compliant, and is therefore not a proper vault, which also vbreaks the expectation of the function and sdai deposit.

## Recommendation

Change the target of sweepIntoDSR into a ERC4626 compliant vault

```solidity
sdai.deposit(amount_, --insert vault here);
```
