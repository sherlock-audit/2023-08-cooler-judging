# Token transfers in `defund` can fail silently
## Summary
Certain token transfers can fail silently in the `Clearinghouse.sol`'s `defund` function potentially causing unexpected behavior.  

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Clearinghouse.sol#L339C1-L357C6 

## Vulnerability Detail
There are tokens that don't revert on failure during a `transfer` call and instead return `false` boolean value. Tokens include the following:
* [EURS](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdb25f211ab05b1c97d595516f45794528a807ad8#code)
* [ZRX Token](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498#code)

When this function is invoked on ERC20 tokens that don't revert on failure, the `transfer` can fail silently. 

## Impact
Since there are no checks on whether the transfer succeeded,  `defund` execution will successfully complete and any previous state changes made prior to the `defund` call and proceeding function executions will be invoked with no issue. This can cause unexpected behavior where on the surface `defund` execution succeeds, but actual tokens were not transferred to the Treasury. 

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function defund(ERC20 token_, uint256 amount_) public onlyRole("cooler_overseer") {
        ....
        token_.transfer(address(TRSRY), amount_);
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Cooler is already securing ERC20 function calls in the `Cooler.sol` with solmate's `SafeTransferlib`, so it's also recommended to use the same library to ensure the `transfer` call in `defund` reverts on failures. 
```solidity
import {SafeTransferLib} from "solmate/utils/SafeTransferLib.sol";
...
using SafeTransferLib for ERC20;
...
token_.safeTransfer(address(TRSRY), amount_);

```
