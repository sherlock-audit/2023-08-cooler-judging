# [H-02] Users borrowing through `Clearinghouse.sol` wont get their collateral tokens back after repayment.
## Summary

Users who deposit the collateral `gohm` and borrow `dai`  through `Clearinghouse.sol` wont get their collateral back after repayment.

## Vulnerability Detail

In [Clearinghouse.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Clearinghouse.sol) the users interact with the contract to borrow `dai` tokens by depositing `gohm`  as collateral. But the issue is that the repayment is done by calling [Cooler: :repayLoan()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/6d34cd12a2a15d2c92307d44782d6eae1474ab25/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol#L177C1-L179C62) (confirmed this with the sponsor) which sends the collateral back to the `owner()` of the deployed Cooler contract. Which necessarily not be our User. This results is loss of collateral for the user. 


## Impact

Loss of deposited collateral for a User borrowing with `Clearinghouse.sol`.

## Code Snippet

```javascript
//File: :Clearinghouse.sol

 function repayLoan(uint256 loanID_, uint256 repaid_) external returns (uint256) {//@audit no interest accured?? //no-issue
        ............................................................................
       ..............................................................................

        // Transfer repaid debt back to the lender and (de)collateral back to the owner.
        debt().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, repayTo, repaid_);
        collateral().safeTransfer(owner(), decollateralized); //@audit collateral is returned back to owner() not User

        // Log the event.
        factory().newEvent(loanID_, CoolerFactory.Events.RepayLoan, repaid_);

        // If necessary, trigger lender callback.
        if (loan.callback) CoolerCallback(loan.lender).onRepay(loanID_, repaid_);
        return decollateralized;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. Can use a data structure to keep track of the borrowers in Cooler.sol
2. Or better way(ig >) is to Implement logic in Cooler.sol to transfer tokens to Clearinghouse.sol (then data structure can be in this contract nad clearinghouse sends collateral to user) or User directly.
