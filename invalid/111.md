# The `claimRepaid` function is not called before the new lender accepts the ownership
## Summary

The lender can transfer the ownership to a new lender, then the new lender accepts it using the `transferOwnership()` function. The problem is that there could be unclaimed amounts that the old lender will lost.

## Vulnerability Detail

The lender can transfer the ownership to the new lender using the [approveTransfer()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol#L338) function. Then the new lender accepts the ownership using the [transferOwnership()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol#L347) function.

In the other hand, lender can specify if the repayments are going [direct to the lender or to the contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol#L262). Then the lender can use the [claimRepaid()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol#L304C14-L304C25) function to get the amount [repaid to the contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol#L170).

The problem is that there could be borrower repayments accumulated in the `loan.unclaimed` and the old lender will lose those payments if the old lender does not claim those amounts.

```solidity
File: Cooler.sol
304:     function claimRepaid(uint256 loanID_) external {
305:         Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];
306: 
307:         // Update storage.
308:         uint256 claim = loan.unclaimed;
309:         delete loans[loanID_].unclaimed;
310: 
311:         // Transfer repaid debt back to the lender.
312:         debt().safeTransfer(loan.lender, claim);
313:     }
```

Please see the next scenario:

1. The lender transfer the ownership using the `approveTransfer()`.
2. Borrower repays the loan and those are accumulated in the `loan.unclaimed` variable.
3. The new lender see there are unclaimed payments and he calls `transferOwnership()` as fast as possible to get the ownership. Also the new lender he can accept the ownership but the old lender forget to claim the unclaimed payments.
4. Now, the new lender can get the unclaimed payments.

There is a possibility that borrower payments occurs while the new lender accepts the ownership, even borrower payments can occur in the same block when the new lender accepts the ownership causing the old lender to not able to claim those payments.

## Impact

When lender transfer the ownership to new lender, the old lender may lost unclaimed payments.

## Code Snippet

- The [transferOwnership()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol#L347) function.
- The [claimRepaid()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol#L304C14-L304C25) function.

## Tool used

Manual review

## Recommendation

Claim the `unclaimed` payments before the new lender transfer:

```diff
    function transferOwnership(uint256 loanID_) external {
        if (msg.sender != approvals[loanID_]) revert OnlyApproved();
++      // Get the last unclaimed payments to the old lender.
++      if (loans[loanID_].unclaimed > 0) claimRepaid(loanID_);
        // Update the load lender.
        loans[loanID_].lender = msg.sender;
        // Clear transfer approvals.
        approvals[loanID_] = address(0);
    }
```
