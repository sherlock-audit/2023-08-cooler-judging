# Debt tokens can be locked away in contract
## Summary
When a borrower repays more debt token than `loan.amount`, it will be locked away in contract with no way of retrieval.
## Vulnerability Detail
Let's take a look at `repayLoan()`:
```solidity
Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];

        if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) revert Default();

        if (repaid_ > loan.amount) repaid_ = loan.amount;

        uint256 decollateralized = (loan.collateral * repaid_) / loan.amount;
        if (decollateralized == 0) revert ZeroCollateralReturned();

        // Update loan memory.
        loan.amount -= repaid_;
        loan.collateral -= decollateralized;
```
When `repaid` is higher than `loan.amount`, `repaid` is updated to be the same as `loan.amount`. After updating the loan details, 
`repaid` amount is sent to lender and borrower receives the `decollateralized` amount of collateral.
```solidity
loans[loanID_] = loan;

        // Transfer repaid debt back to the lender and (de)collateral back to the owner.
        debt().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, repayTo, repaid_);
        collateral().safeTransfer(owner(), decollateralized);
```
However, this function lacks the mechanic to handle unused debt token.

## Impact
Lost of debt token

## Recommendation
```solidity
function repayLoan(uint256 loanID_, uint256 repaid_) external returns (uint256) {
        Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];

        if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) revert Default();

-       if (repaid_ > loan.amount) repaid_ = loan.amount;
+       if (repaid_ > loan.amount){
+       uint256 amountToReturn = repaid - loan.amount;
+       repaid = loan.amount;
+       }    

        uint256 decollateralized = (loan.collateral * repaid_) / loan.amount;
        if (decollateralized == 0) revert ZeroCollateralReturned();

        // Update loan memory.
        loan.amount -= repaid_;
        loan.collateral -= decollateralized;

        address repayTo;
        // Check whether repayment needs to be manually claimed or not.
        if (loan.repayDirect) {
            repayTo = loan.lender;
        } else {
            repayTo = address(this);
            loan.unclaimed += repaid_;
        }

        // Save updated loan info in storage.
        loans[loanID_] = loan;

        // Transfer repaid debt back to the lender and (de)collateral back to the owner.
        debt().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, repayTo, repaid_);
+       debt().safeTransfer(msg.sender, amountToReturn);
        collateral().safeTransfer(owner(), decollateralized);

        // Log the event.
        factory().newEvent(loanID_, CoolerFactory.Events.RepayLoan, repaid_);

        // If necessary, trigger lender callback.
        if (loan.callback) CoolerCallback(loan.lender).onRepay(loanID_, repaid_);
        return decollateralized;
    }
```
