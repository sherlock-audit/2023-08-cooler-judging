# Validate input data such as loanID_ to ensure existence of loans.
## Summary
In some functions, the input parameters are not validated to checkout whether the service exists or not.
Additional validation should be added.
## Vulnerability Detail
In some of the logic implementations of lending function, the deficiency of input validation might lead to unintended behavior and it is highly recommended to follow the check-effect-interaction pattern.
```solidity
function claimRepaid(uint256 loanID_) external {
    Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];

    // Update storage.
    uint256 claim = loan.unclaimed;
    delete loans[loanID_].unclaimed;

    // Transfer repaid debt back to the lender.
    debt().safeTransfer(loan.lender, claim);
}
```
The above function lacks the `check` pattern and if the `loanID_` exceeds the length of loans array, the token might transfer to an unknown address and fail to get it back.
## Impact
It might lead to the token locking in unknown addresses (especially the zero address).

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Adopt the validation of input data. For example, add a simple modifier.

```solidity
function claimRepaid(uint256 loanID_) external {
    require(loanID_<=loans.length, "loan id not exists");
    Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];

    // Update storage.
    uint256 claim = loan.unclaimed;
    delete loans[loanID_].unclaimed;

    // Transfer repaid debt back to the lender.
    debt().safeTransfer(loan.lender, claim);
}
```
