# Unchecked return value for transferFrom calls
## Summary
The ```transferFrom``` function in the lendToCooler function of the contract could potentially pose a security risk. This function is used to transfer the gOHM tokens from the user to the contract. However, there is no explicit check to ensure that the transferFrom function call was successful.

## Vulnerability Detail
 the transferFrom function returns a boolean value indicating whether the transfer was successful or not. If the transferFrom function fails for any reason (such as insufficient balance or allowance), it will return false. However, in the current implementation, the contract does not check the return value of the transferFrom function. This means that if the transferFrom function fails, the contract will continue executing, potentially leading to incorrect contract state or loss of funds.

## Impact
If the return value is not checked and it doesn't return true then the transfer can silently fail leading to the unwanted contract state.
