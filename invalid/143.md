# Loan defaults if lender is on debt token blacklist
## Summary

First, the borrower must call `requestLoan` on the Cooler. If the lender calls `clearRequest` with `repayDirect_ = true`, and then either transfers loan ownership to an account on the debt token blacklist or somehow gets themselves on the debt token blacklist, they can force `repayLoan` to never succeed. 

## Vulnerability Detail

In this [Previous issue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler-judging/issues/23) it was found that the lender can create an attack where they provide a loan to a borrower, but when the borrower attempts to repay it they are unable to because the lender is on the debt token blacklist. Thus the loan can never be repaid and the lender can automatically seize the borrowers collateral. 

It turns out this was never fixed -- the additions in the code simply allow the lender to decide whether to `repayDirect` or not. However, since the lender is the attacker here, the lender can run the exact same attack by passing `repayDirect_ = true`.

Then, the debt tokens must be repaid to the lender, which will revert because the lender is on the blacklist: 

```solidity
        if (loan.repayDirect) {
            repayTo = loan.lender;
        } else {
            repayTo = address(this);
            loan.unclaimed += repaid_;
        }

        // Save updated loan info in storage.
        loans[loanID_] = loan;

        // Transfer repaid debt back to the lender and (de)collateral back to the owner.
        debt().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, repayTo, repaid_);
```

Thus, the loan will forcibly default and the lender will be able to claim the collateral tokens at the end. 

## Impact

Loan will automatically default and borrower will lose collateral

## Recommendation

Let borrower choose `repayDirect_` instead of lender.
