# An attacker can create a requestLoan with his own parameters
## Summary

The requestLoan() function (https://github.com/ohmzeus/Cooler/blob/c6f2bbe1b51cdf3bb4d078875170177a1b8ba2a3/src/Clearinghouse.sol#L144) is called in the lendToCooler() function with fixed parameters:

uint256 reqID = cooler_.requestLoan(amount_, INTEREST_RATE, LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL, DURATION)

INTEREST_RATE, LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL, DURATION are constants (https://github.com/ohmzeus/Cooler/blob/c6f2bbe1b51cdf3bb4d078875170177a1b8ba2a3/src/Clearinghouse.sol#L54-L56):

uint256 public constant INTEREST_RATE = 5e15; // 0.5%
uint256 public constant LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL = 3000e18; // 3,000 DAI/gOHM
uint256 public constant DURATION = 121 days;

However, an attacker can call the requestLoan() function (https://github.com/ohmzeus/Cooler/blob/c6f2bbe1b51cdf3bb4d078875170177a1b8ba2a3/src/Cooler.sol#L98-L125) directly in Cooler.sol and register their parameters INTEREST_RATE, LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL, DU RATION. This will manipulate the size of the INTEREST_RATE, LOAN_TO_COLLATERAL, DURATION parameters and write incorrect data to requests.
This function is of type external and there is no check who is calling the function.

function requestLoan(
     uint256 amount_,
     uint256 interest_,
     uint256 loanToCollateral_,
     uint256 duration_
) external returns (uint256 reqID) {
     reqID = requests.length;
     requests.push(
         Request({
             amount: amount_,
             interest: interest_,
             loanToCollateral: loanToCollateral_,
             duration: duration_,
             active: true
         })
     );

     // The collateral is taken upfront. will be escrowed
     // until the loan is repaid or defaulted.
     collateral().safeTransferFrom(
         msg.sender,
         address(this),
         collateralFor(amount_, loanToCollateral_)
     );

     // Log the event.
     factory().newEvent(reqID, CoolerFactory.Events.RequestLoan, 0);
}
