# Possible reentrancy attack on claimDefaulted
## Summary
Because of the way the ```claimDefaulted()``` is written under ```Clearinghouse.sol``` an attacker can reenter the function using the fallback function to get infinite keeperRewards
## Vulnerability Detail
 the ```claimDefaulted()``` function under  ```Clearinghouse.sol`` do not comply with the check effect interaction pattern. The last interaction should be sending rewards to the keeper but it is done before unstaking and burning gOHM. An attacker can reenter the function before gOHM tokens  are unstaked and burnt when he receive the rewards inside his fallback function.  
## Impact
High impact causes Cooler to send infinite keeper reward to the same address for the same transaction .
