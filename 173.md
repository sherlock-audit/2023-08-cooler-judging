# Abuse checkDefaulted to drain entire treasury through keeper fees
## Summary

I will start off by noting that this exploit has the potential to drain the entire treasury without burning any of your own gOHM. The key vulnerability is that `claimDefaulted` in `ClearingHouse.sol` does not check that a defaulted loan was given out by the ClearingHouse (and it also doesn't check that the debt token is DAI and collateral token is gOHM). This allows an attacker to create their own loans (through directly interacting with the Cooler), have them default, call `claimDefaulted` in `ClearingHouse.sol`, and receive keeper rewards while losing no collateral. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The attacker will start off by taking out a very large loan from the ClearingHouse (so now you have a bunch of DAI, and the Cooler contract has your gOHM) and wait 4 months until it defaults. 

Now, the attacker will create their own extremely large self-loans directly through their own cooler (so calls both `requestLoan` and `clearRequest`) and have them default in a short duration. The attacker can, but doesn't need to, use DAI and gOHM as the debt and collateral tokens in the Cooler; they can also just create a cooler out of their own custom ERC20 tokens to reduce the amount of capital needed. The self-loans can then be created by transferring around these custom ERC20 tokens. 

The attacker then calls `claimDefaulted` in `ClearingHouse.sol` with the very large loan they took out from the clearing house as well as all the self loans. From the ClearingHouse loan, the ClearingHouse receives the gOHM the attacker initially set in back. Because `claimDefaulted` in `ClearingHouse.sol` does not check whether a loan was given out by the ClearingHouse or not when distributing keeper rewards (but only checks if it was created by the factory, which even a cooler with the attacker's own custom ERC20 tokens is), 5% of the defaulted self-loan's collateral (which is easy to control since the attacker just used their own custom ERC-20 tokens, so the collateral is really expressed in a custom ERC-20 token controlled by the attacker) will be used to inform the keeper's reward.  

```solidity

        for (uint256 i=0; i < loans;) {
            // Validate that cooler was deployed by the trusted factory.
            if (!factory.created(coolers_[i])) revert OnlyFromFactory();
            
            // Claim defaults and update cached metrics.
            (uint256 debt, uint256 collateral, uint256 elapsed) = Cooler(coolers_[i]).claimDefaulted(loans_[i]);
            uint256 interest = interestFromDebt(debt);
            unchecked {
                // Cannot overflow due to max supply limits for both tokens
                totalDebt += debt;
                totalInterest += interest;
                totalCollateral += collateral;
                // There will not exist more than 2**256 loans
                ++i;
            }

            // Cap rewards to 5% of the collateral to avoid OHM holder's dillution.
            uint256 maxAuctionReward = collateral * 5e16 / 1e18;
            // Cap rewards to avoid exorbitant amounts.
            uint256 maxReward = (maxAuctionReward < MAX_REWARD)
                ? maxAuctionReward
                : MAX_REWARD;
            // Calculate rewards based on the elapsed time since default.
            keeperRewards = (elapsed < 7 days)
                ? keeperRewards + maxReward * elapsed / 7 days
                : keeperRewards + maxReward;
        }
```

Note that there's an upper bound on the maxReward per defaulted loan (`MAX_REWARD`), which is why we need to use multiple self-loans to get to the maximum amount exploited. The amount elapsed is also taken into account, so the attacker should wait around a week with these defaulted self-loans.

Now, the `keeperRewards` variable will be quite large (hopefully equal to the amount of `gOHM` the ClearingHouse contract retrieved back from the large ClearingHouse loan default). `claimDefaulted` (`ClearingHouse.sol`) later calls: `gOHM.transfer(msg.sender, keeperRewards);`. This will cause the `gOHM` from the large ClearingHouse loan to be sent back to the attacker. 

So, at the end, the attacker is up both the DAI and the gOHM collateral from the large ClearingHouse loan. 

Interestingly enough, in the first step, instead of requesting their own large loan through the ClearingHouse, the attacker can also find someone else's large defaulted loan (with the ClearingHouse as the lender) and call `claimDefaulted` directly on the Cooler contract. This will lead to the `gOHM` collateral being sent to the ClearingHouse but it will not be burned. The attacker can then extract this `gOHM` with the repeated self-loans. 

## Impact

Drain the entire treasury without burning any of your gOHM.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check that any loan passed into `claimDefaulted` in `ClearingHouse.sol` had the ClearingHouse as lender.
