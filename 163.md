# Malicious user may claim  preivous owner's   reward  by  `transferOwnership`
## Summary
Malicious user may claim  preivous owner's   reward  by  `transferOwnership`   
## Vulnerability Detail
Once lender decide to  transfer loan, he will  approve the new lender.   The  new lender can choose  any time  to become actually owner. 

```solidity
    function transferOwnership(uint256 loanID_) external {
        if (msg.sender != approvals[loanID_]) revert OnlyApproved();

        // Update the load lender.
        loans[loanID_].lender = msg.sender;
        // Clear transfer approvals.
        approvals[loanID_] = address(0);
    }
```
The issue is ,  if lender do not  choose  `repayDirect`   , the collateral which  should belong to the old  lender will  stay  in  contract .
If the old lender notice borrower  repay the collateral and want   claim  , malicious  new lender may front run  `transferOwnership` and  get  token.

```solidity
    function claimRepaid(uint256 loanID_) external {
        Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];

        // Update storage.
        uint256 claim = loan.unclaimed;
        delete loans[loanID_].unclaimed;

        // Transfer repaid debt back to the lender.
@>        debt().safeTransfer(loan.lender, claim);
    }
```

## Impact
Lender's unclaim token may get stolen
