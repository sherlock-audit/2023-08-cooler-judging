# `if (!factory.created(` checks are invalid allowing malicious Coolers to be deployed to steal protocol's funds
## Summary
`if (!factory.created(` are invalid and don't check anything allowing a malicious actor to deploy a malicious Cooler and steal protocol funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

The lines `if (!factory.created(` are invalid in `Clearinghouse.sol` and don't check anything.

```solidity
Clearinghouse.sol

133        if (!factory.created(address(cooler_))) revert OnlyFromFactory();
162        if (!factory.created(address(cooler_))) revert OnlyFromFactory();
201            if (!factory.created(coolers_[i])) revert OnlyFromFactory();
```

Unlike in `CoolerCallback.sol`, `factory`isn't initialized in `Clearinghouse.sol`.

And the tests in `Clearinghouse.t.sol` supposed to check for it are wrongly checking for revert but the check return `false` and doesn't revert.

```solidity
Clearinghouse.t.sol

229, 351, 588, 705        vm.expectRevert(CoolerCallback.OnlyFromFactory.selector);
```

Foundry test returns `false` but doesn't revert so the test pass:
```diff
    │   ├─ [2594] CoolerFactory::created(0x0552d275e243b4eE8779aDD4D65528E5b95Adc73) [staticcall]
    │   │   └─ ← false
```

Therefore a bad actor can create a malicious `Cooler` with malicious logic in the lending contract and steal lenders' funds.

## Impact

`Coolers` not created by the `CoolerFactory` could be malicious and used to steal protocol's funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Initialize `CoolerFactory` in `Clearinghouse.sol` so the checks will work:

```diff

+  CoolerFactory public immutable factory;

    constructor(
        address gohm_,
        address staking_,
        address sdai_,
        address coolerFactory_,
        address kernel_
    ) Policy(Kernel(kernel_)) CoolerCallback(coolerFactory_) {
        // Store the relevant contracts.
        gOHM = ERC20(gohm_);
        staking = IStaking(staking_);
        sdai = ERC4626(sdai_);
        dai = ERC20(sdai.asset());
+      factory = CoolerFactory(coolerFactory_);        

        // Initialize the contract status and its funding schedule.
        active = true;
        fundTime = block.timestamp;
    }

```
