# Clearinghouse bad treasury debt accounting and gOHM stack in the contract
## Summary
Treasury debt will not be updated and gOHM not burned if someone calls claimDefaulted on defaulted loans funded by clearinghouses directly on Cooler, not Clearinghouses.

## Vulnerability Detail
Defaulted loans from clearinghouse supposed to be claimed in Clearinghouse::claimDefaulted(). This function calls Cooler::claimDefaulted and then 1. update treasury debt and 2. burn claimed collateral - gOHM. But Cooler::claimDefaulted permissionless and if someone will call it directly on Cooler contract, Clearinghouse::claimDefaulted will revert on these loans because collateral already claimed and loans deleted and 1. and 2. important steps will not be executed. And there is no way to do it later.

## Impact
Unburnable gOHM stack in the Clearinghouse contract, bad treasury debt accounting

Make claimDefaulted callable only by lender or/and add functionality to burn gOHM from Clearinghouse and update treasury debt.
