# The borrower will not be able to repay his loan if `loan.repayDirect` is set to true and the lender got blacklisted by the debt token
## Summary

The lender can DoS the borrower from repaying his loan if `loan.repayDirect` is set to true and the lender got blacklisted by the debt token.

## Vulnerability Detail

- In `Cooler.sol`: when a lender clears a loan request; he can set `repayDirect` which tells the protocol whether to transfer the repaid debt directly to the lender or let the lender claim it from the protocol.
- This loan parameter is meant to overcome the debt token blacklisting.
- But the lender might get later blacklisted from th debt token; thus making the borrower unable to repay his loan as `repayLoan` function will revert if `loan.repayDirect` is set to true.

- Vulnerability scenaio:

  1.  the borrower requests a loan.
  2.  the lender clears the request by calling `clearRequest` function with `repayDirect_` parameter set to **true** (as he's currently not blacklisted by the debt token):

  ```solidity
    function clearRequest(
        uint256 reqID_,
        bool repayDirect_, //true
        bool isCallback_
    ) external returns (uint256 loanID)
  ```

  3. then later the lender got blacklisted by the debt token.
  4. so when the borrower tries to repay his loan; the `repayLoan` function will revert since the protocol tries to send debt tokens directly to the blacklisted lender:

     ```solidity
         if (loan.repayDirect) {
             repayTo = loan.lender;
     ```

     [L178 :](https://github.com/ohmzeus/Cooler/blob/c6f2bbe1b51cdf3bb4d078875170177a1b8ba2a3/src/Cooler.sol#L178)

     ```solidity
     debt().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, repayTo, repaid_); // @audit : this line will revert if the lender got blacklisted by the debt token.
     ```

## Impact

This will disable the borrower from repaying his loan.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Let the lender claim his debt tokens (pulling) instead of sending them directly to him (pushing).
