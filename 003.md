# Cooler.sol#rollLoan() - malicious lender can roll loan to force higher interest
## Summary
The roll over function in the ``Borrower`` specified section of the Cooler contract can be called by anybody, including the lender, who should have set the new terms beforehand, giving him power over the active loan.

## Vulnerability Detail
A malicious lender can change the interest rate to force the borrower to repay a great amount of tokens or to steal their collateral through forced defaulting. Even though the ``rollLoan()`` takes the new collateral from the sender, the incentive to steal tokens is of greater value to the attacker.

## Impact
Stealing of funds, forcefully defaulting(liquidating) loans.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
This issue has been validated in the previous audit of the protocol, but it has not been resolved in this version, implement a tracking system for request creators and make sure only the borrower can roll his loan terms.
