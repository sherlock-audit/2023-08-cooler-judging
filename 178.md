# Collateral Would Be 0 If The Amount Of DAI Lent is > 1e3
## Summary

Function `lendToCooler` is used to lend DAI to the cooler. A user can specify how much DAI to lend by setting the `_amount`
parameter. For this a collateral is calculated that is paid by the user , this collateral is gOHM. But if an amount of > 1e3 is provided
, the collateral would be calculated as 0 , meaning no gOHM collateral paid by the user.

## Vulnerability Detail

1.) User calls https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Clearinghouse.sol#L129 
with an amount of 1e2 (DAI to lend)

2.) We reach the line L138 where collateral amount is calculated (with an amount of 1e2)

3.) This is the function that calculates the collateral (inside Cooler.sol)

```solidity

function collateralFor(uint256 amount_, uint256 loanToCollateral_) public view returns (uint256) {
        return (amount_ * (10 ** collateral().decimals())) / loanToCollateral_;
    }

``` 
Due to rounding , collateral amount get's calculated to 0 ( loanToCollateral is 3000e18 inside ClearingHouse.sol)

4.) At L139  , receivables do not get updated as collateral is 0 and at L140 we send 0 collateral to the contract.


## Impact

User can successfully lend to the cooler with pledging 0 collateral.

## Tool used

Manual , Foundry

## Recommendation

Have a minimum value for amount to lend to the cooler , i.e. 1e3
