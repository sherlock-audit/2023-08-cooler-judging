# transfer() and transferFrom() return booleans are never checked within Clearinghouse.sol.
## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

Erc20 tokens are transferred with transfer() 3 times and transferFrom() 2 times within Clreainghouse.sol.  Those two functions return a boolean when called for dai, sDai, and gOHM tokens, but this return value is never checked within Clearinghouse.sol.  If these function calls fail for any reason, then the lendToCooler(), rollLoan(), claimDefaulted(), rebalance(), and _sweepIntoDRS()  functions that use them will not revert when they should.

## Impact

If the functions listed above donâ€™t revert when transfer() or tranferFrom() fail, then this could lead to numerous unexpected accounting errors within the contract.

## Code Snippet

The link below leads to the 5 instances where transfer and transferFrom are used:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

There are two solutions.  The return booleans of the transfer can be checked via a require statement.  The second solution is to implement safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom by utilizing SafeTransferLib.sol.
