# Interest calculation in claimDefaulted in Clearinghouse is incorrect
## Summary
Interest calculation in ``claimDefaulted`` in ``ClearingHouse`` is incorrect resulting in ``outstandingDebt`` from ``TRSRY`` being incorrectly updated.

## Vulnerability Detail
In ``claimDefaulted``, keepers may batch ``claimDefaulted`` calls on Coolers. For each cooler/loan pair, defaulted debt and interest on the debt is accummulated to ``totalDebt`` and ``totalInterest`` respectively. The interest for a certain defaulted loan is calculated using [``interestFromDebt``](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/6d34cd12a2a15d2c92307d44782d6eae1474ab25/Cooler/src/Clearinghouse.sol#L395-L399) where ``debt_`` is the defaulted debt amount which *includes interest*. This is flawed as interest on a loan (which is paid by the borrower, not lent using funds from ``TRSRY``) should be fixed and separate from the actual loaned amount (which uses ``TRSRY`` funds).

Consider the following example using the constant loan conditions in ``ClearingHouse`` (real numbers and no precision are used for simplicity):
``loan = 60000 DAI``
``interest = 5/1000 * 1/3  * 60000 = 100`` (taking duration as 1/3 of year for simplicity)

After borrower repays 30000 DAI, they default and ``claimDefaulted is called``.
``debt = 60100 - 30000 = 30100``
``interest = 5/1000 * 1/3 * 30100 = (approx.) 50 < 100``

If instead none of the debt is repaid,
``debt = 60100``
``interest = 5/1000 * 1/3 * 60100 = 100 + 1/6 > 100``

In either case, the interest calculated is incorrect and will distort the update to ``outstandingDebt`` which subtracts ``totalDebt - totalInterest``.

## Impact
Debt accounting in ``claimDefaulted`` in ``ClearingHouse`` is inaccurate and inaccuracies will accrue over time, causing undefined negative consequences in ``TRSRY`` accounting and the rest of the Olympus protocol (these areas are out of scope, but the main issue lies in ``ClearingHouse`` and I'm assuming accounting is significant, otherwise it wouldn't be updated).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider introducing a separate field in ``Loan`` that caches the interest when clearing a request and use this for accounting for ``totalInterest``.
