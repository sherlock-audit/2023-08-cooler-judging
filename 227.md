# Borrower can request loan without transfering collateral
## Summary
The  `requestLoan` which is designed to allow users to request a loan by specifying various parameters but this function uses solmate’s SafeTransferLib 's functions which does not check that a token has code or not and always returns success .

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in the usage of the `safeTransferFrom` function of solmate’s SafeTransferLib to transfer collateral tokens from the borrower to the smart contract. None of the functions in this library check that a token has code . That responsibility is delegated to the caller.As a result, when the token’s address has no code, the transaction will just succeed with no error.The borrowers can deploy new cooler with non existent address of the collateral,This can happen many projects likes to deploy tokens to same address on different chains and if that project is yet to deploy on some chain,if borrower is not aware of the fact he might choose address of token but it isnt available on this chain yet transaction will go through, and borrower can receive loans without transferring collateral

## Impact
Lender can face heavy loss because borrower wont have to repay the loan and will not face any consequences.


## Code Snippet

```solidity
 function requestLoan(
        uint256 amount_,
        uint256 interest_,
        uint256 loanToCollateral_,
        uint256 duration_
    ) external returns (uint256 reqID) {
        reqID = requests.length;
        requests.push(
            Request({
                amount: amount_,
                interest: interest_,
                loanToCollateral: loanToCollateral_,
                duration: duration_,
                active: true
            })
        );

        // The collateral is taken upfront. Will be escrowed
        // until the loan is repaid or defaulted.
        collateral().safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            collateralFor(amount_, loanToCollateral_)
        );

        // Log the event.
        factory().newEvent(reqID, CoolerFactory.Events.RequestLoan, 0);
    }
    ```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add a additional require statement to check if contract has a code or not
