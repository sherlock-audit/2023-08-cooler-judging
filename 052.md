# Clearinghouse.sol#rebalance() - If Olympus's TRSRY goes inactive, `rebalance` will brick.
## Summary
If Olympus's TRSRY goes inactive or it doesn't have enough tokens in reserve, `rebalance` will brick.

## Vulnerability Detail
[Olympus V3 TRSRY](https://docs.olympusdao.finance/main/technical/contract-docs/modules/TRSRY/TRSRYv1#active) has a variable called `active`. If this is set to `false` many functions from the `TRSRY` will revert when called, including `withdrawReserves` which is called inside `rebalance`.

The likelihood of this scenario occurring is small,  so I consider this a Medium.
## Impact
The protocol won't rebalance correctly, effectively not receiving enough `DAI` to lend to users which will brick half the protocol.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Wrap the relevant code inside of `rebalance` in a `try/catch` block and handle a revert from the `TRSRY` accordingly. I suggest using something like `emergencyShutdown` to deactivate the protocol.
