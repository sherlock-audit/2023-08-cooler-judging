# Cooler#provideNewTermsForRoll A lender can create loans without the borrower knowing
## Summary
A lender can fake loan request from the borrower's name and create unwanted loans for the borrower.

## Vulnerability Detail
Loans should be created only when the borrower request for them but provideNewTermsForRoll cause unexpected behavior and the lender can create loans. 
Lender calls provideNewTermsForRoll, so the request.active would be set to true. Then calls clearRequest, where new loans are created with the requestID from the provideNewTermsForRoll. Since the only check there is request.active to be true, that pass and new loan is created. Thus he pushes the borrower to repay loans that he did not want, and it's all in lender's favour. 

## Impact
The borrower will be obligated to repay unwanted loans.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a new member to the struct and use two different members for **active loan request** and **active roll request**
```solidity
    struct Request {
        uint256 amount; // Amount to be borrowed.
        uint256 interest; // Annualized percentage to be paid as interest.
        uint256 loanToCollateral; // Requested loan-to-collateral ratio.
        uint256 duration; // Time to repay the loan before it defaults.
        bool active; // Any lender can clear an active loan request.
        bool activeRoll; // @note add 
    }
```
```solidity
        loan.request = Request(
            loan.amount,
            interest_,
            loanToCollateral_,
            duration_,
            false,
            true // @note set only the activeRoll to true
        );
```
