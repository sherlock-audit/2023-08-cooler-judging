# rollLoan() adds interest for the full loan's tenure instead of the elapsed duration
## Summary
Whenever a loan is rolled over, the interest is calculated for the entire duration of the loan and added to the total loan amount. 

E.g `duration=121days` in `clearingHouse` so if the loan is rolled over after 10 days, the interest added to the total loan amount will be that for the entire duration which is 121 days


## Vulnerability Detail
See summary and code snippet

## Impact
Borrower has to pay interest equivalent to that of the entire loan tenure instead of only for the actual borrowed duration

Interest should be added for only the elapsed duration of the loan during rollover
