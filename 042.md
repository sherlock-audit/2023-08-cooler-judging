# Gas Limitation and Reentrancy Attack
## Summary
never use transfer function is solidity

## Vulnerability Detail
The transfer function was initially recommended due to its built-in protection against reentrancy attacks. The function only forwards a fixed amount of gas (2300 gas) which was not enough for the recipient contract to execute any state-changing operations, thus preventing reentrancy. However, this mechanism has a significant drawback. If the recipient contract's fallback function consumes more than 2300 gas, the transfer function will fail, leading to unexpected behavior

Dependency on Gas Costs
A contract that uses transfer or send is taking a hard dependency on gas costs by forwarding a fixed amount of gas: 2300. The gas costs are subject to change, and smart contracts canâ€™t depend on any particular gas costs. 



## Impact
reenterancy attack
high gas costing smart contract

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 it's recommended to use the .call method, which forwards all available gas, and to use the "checks-effects-interactions" pattern to prevent reentrancy attacks
