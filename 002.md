# Malicious lender could DOS repayLoan for borrower
## Summary
A potential vulnerability has been identified in the Cooler smart contract that could allow a malicious lender to execute a Denial of Service (DOS) attack on borrowers attempting to repay their loans. The attack involves transferring ownership of a loan to a blacklisted wallet using the transferOwnership function, which in turn prevents the borrower from repaying the loan due to the blacklisted status. Once the loan expires, the malicious lender can transfer the ownership back and claim defaulted collateral tokens.
## Vulnerability Detail
The malicious lender can exploit the vulnerability by using the `clearRequest` function to fulfill a loan request containing valuable collateral tokens. By employing the `approveTransfer` function with the parameter to set to their blacklisted address, along with the loan ID, the lender transfers ownership to the blacklisted wallet using the `transferOwnership` function. Consequently, the loan ownership is held by a wallet blacklisted by the debt token, rendering any repayment attempts futile. After the loan reaches its expiration, the malicious lender can revert the ownership to their clean wallet and utilize the claimDefaulted function to acquire the valuable collateral tokens.
## Impact
This vulnerability exposes borrowers to the risk of losing their collateral due to potential DOS attacks executed by malicious lenders.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement a mitigation strategy that restricts the transfer of loan ownership for loans with the repayDirect parameter set to true. This restriction would prevent the described exploit and enhance the overall security of the Cooler smart contract.
