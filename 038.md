# clearRequest sends funds to Owner not to the  borrower
## Summary

clearRequest should send funds to the person who requested the loan. Instead it goes to `owner()`

## Vulnerability Detail

In the cooler contract, a borrower requests a loan and are required to send their own tokens as collateral to the contract.

Reasonable you would expect that when their request is cleared, they get their tokens since they put up collateral and requested to borrow.

Instead, in clear loan, the funds are sent to the owner:

```solidity
debt().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, owner(), req.amount);
```

## Impact

- The borrower does not get funds for their collateral
- The borrower can't repay their loan because they never got paid in the first place

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add `borrower` to the loan struct. Then change the transfer to this line:

```solidity
debt().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, loan.borrower, req.amount);
```
