# A borrower have to always pay interest for the entire loan tenure even if the loan duration is much shorter
## Summary
When borrowing, interest is added in the loan amount for the entire loan tenure. So the borrower has to repay loan along with interest for the entire duration

## Vulnerability Detail
As seen in the code snippet, `amount: req.amount + interest`.
When `clearRequest()` is called, interest is calculated for the full loan tenure and added in the loan amount.

So a borrower has to pay this interest even if the loan is borrowed for a much shorter duration.

## Impact
Borrower has to pay uncecessary interest

## Code Snippet

[clearRequest()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol#L250-L257)
```solidity
    function clearRequest(
        uint256 reqID_,
        bool repayDirect_,
        bool isCallback_
    ) external returns (uint256 loanID) {
        .
        .
        // Calculate and store loan terms.
        uint256 interest = interestFor(req.amount, req.interest, req.duration);
        .
        .
        .
        loans.push(
            Loan({
                request: req,
                amount: req.amount + interest,
                unclaimed: 0,
                collateral: collat,
                expiry: expiration,
                lender: msg.sender,
                repayDirect: repayDirect_,
                callback: isCallback_
            })
        );
        .
        .
        .
    }
