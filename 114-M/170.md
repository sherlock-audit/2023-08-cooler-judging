# The borrower will pay the full interest amount regardless of the debt duration
## Summary

The protocol doesn't take into account the duration of borrowed debt and charges the borrower the full interest amount; so if he repays the loan directly after a lender clears the loan request or just before the loan defaults; then he will pay the same interest amount.

## Vulnerability Detail

- In `Cooler.sol`: when a lender clears a loan request; the loan amount that is going to be repaid later by the borrower is set to debt amount + interest:
  [L257:](https://github.com/ohmzeus/Cooler/blob/c6f2bbe1b51cdf3bb4d078875170177a1b8ba2a3/src/Cooler.sol#L257)

       ```solidity
      amount: req.amount + interest,
       ```

- But when the borrower wants to fully repay his loan; he will be charged the full interest rate regardless of the debt duration :
  [L156:](https://github.com/ohmzeus/Cooler/blob/c6f2bbe1b51cdf3bb4d078875170177a1b8ba2a3/src/Cooler.sol#L156)

       ```solidity
         if (repaid_ > loan.amount) repaid_ = loan.amount;
       ```

## Impact

So whether the borrower repays his loan early or late; he will always be charged the full interest amount.

## Recommendation

Modify the interest on loan to be repaid based on the elapsed borrow duration.
