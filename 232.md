# Lender can roll the loan on his own wish
## Summary
A lender can roll the loan as many times as he wants without the borrower's permission. This increases the debt by interest amount every time rollLoan is called until the borrower has fully repaid the outstanding debt. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The lender can completely destroy the loan scheme using rollLoan. The ```rollLoan``` function can be called by anyone. Suppose that the lender calls ```provideNewTermsForRoll``` with duration, rate and ```loanToCollateral``` of his choice, and then himself calls rollsLoan. This rollsLoan call adds new debt in the form of interest for the newly proposed roll duration. See Line 200, interest is only calculated using amount, rate and duration out of which amount is fixed (+previous interest) and rate and duration are supplied by lender in the roll proposal. See Line 199, the newCollateral is calculated with amount, and loanToCollateral which is again supplied by lender. He can easily use a value that leads to zero newCollateral to bypass the collateral transfer at Line 212.
The lender call rollLoan as many times as he wishes at the beginning of the loan duration(just after the request is accepted) when none of the amount has been repaid. This way, the lender can roll the loan unlimited times and add debt exponentially without any real cost of tokens.

## Impact
The borrower is forced to default because his debt will be exponential and the lender can keep all the collateral which may be worth alot. This is critical severity since lender controls all the new loan terms and because there are other ways to do this too : by frontrunning repayment txns with rollLoan and reducing the collateral rescued in every repayment txn.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Loan should only be rolled with both parties' permission. If provideNewTermsForRoll can only be called by the lender, then rollLoan should only be accessible to the borrower. You should add independent approval mechanism for rolling the loan where both parties agree on the new terms.
