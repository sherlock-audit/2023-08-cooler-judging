# When a loan can be liquidated, anyone can `claimDefaulted` on behalf of the lender, even if it is not authorized by the lender
## Summary
When the loan is liquidatable, it can be liquidated by the lender or anyone approved by the lender. However, after the loan becomes liquidatable, anyone can initiate a `claimDefaulted()` on behalf of the lender to liquidate the loan, even if it was not intended by the lender. This means the lender will be forced to call `claimDefaulted()` to `withdraw collateral even if he/she intended to provide new terms for the loan to be rolled over`.

## Vulnerability Detail
`Cooler#claimDefaulted()` would pass if the loan is defaulted (the borrower does not repay in time). In that case, anyone can trigger a claiming of collateral on behalf of the lender, even if the lender would provide new terms for loan to be rolled over.

When `block.timestamp > loan.expiry` is true, this loan will be liquidatable.
```solidity
    function claimDefaulted(
        uint256 loanID_
    ) external returns (uint256, uint256, uint256) {
        Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];
        delete loans[loanID_];

        if (block.timestamp <= loan.expiry) revert NoDefault();

        // Transfer defaulted collateral to the lender.
        collateral().safeTransfer(loan.lender, loan.collateral);

        ...
    }
```

## Impact
The lack of access control disrupts the normal liquidation flow, which is clearly a high impact.

## Recommendation
To ensure only the lender can claim the collateral of defaulted loan, you should add a check for the sender's address against the lender's address.

```solidity
    function claimDefaulted(uint256 loanID_) external returns (uint256, uint256, uint256) {
        Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];
        delete loans[loanID_];

+       if (msg.sender != loan.lender) revert OnlyApproved();
        if (block.timestamp <= loan.expiry) revert NoDefault();

        // Transfer defaulted collateral to the lender.
        collateral().safeTransfer(loan.lender, loan.collateral);

        // Log the event.
        factory().newEvent(loanID_, CoolerFactory.Events.DefaultLoan, 0);

        // If necessary, trigger lender callback.
        if (loan.callback) CoolerCallback(loan.lender).onDefault(loanID_, loan.amount, loan.collateral);
        return (loan.amount, loan.collateral, block.timestamp - loan.expiry);
    }
```
