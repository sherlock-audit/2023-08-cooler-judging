# A borrower can repay a loan without paying interest
## Summary
A borrower can repay a loan by calling [repayLoan()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol#L151-L187). In this function, interest is not added and only the borrowed amount is transferred from the user.


## Vulnerability Detail
The `repayLoan()` function transfers only the borrowed amount to the lender and transfers collateral back to the user. So the borrower ends up clearing the loan without paying any interest.

## Impact
Lender won't receive interest for the loan.

## Code Snippet

[Cooler.sol repayLoan()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol#L151-L187)

```solidity
    function repayLoan(uint256 loanID_, uint256 repaid_) external returns (uint256) {
        Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];

        if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) revert Default();

        if (repaid_ > loan.amount) repaid_ = loan.amount;

        uint256 decollateralized = (loan.collateral * repaid_) / loan.amount;
        if (decollateralized == 0) revert ZeroCollateralReturned();

        // Update loan memory.
        loan.amount -= repaid_;
        loan.collateral -= decollateralized;

        address repayTo;
        // Check whether repayment needs to be manually claimed or not.
        if (loan.repayDirect) {
            repayTo = loan.lender;
        } else {
            repayTo = address(this);
            loan.unclaimed += repaid_;
        }

        // Save updated loan info in storage.
        loans[loanID_] = loan;

        // Transfer repaid debt back to the lender and (de)collateral back to the owner.
        debt().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, repayTo, repaid_);
        collateral().safeTransfer(owner(), decollateralized);

        // Log the event.
        factory().newEvent(loanID_, CoolerFactory.Events.RepayLoan, repaid_);

        // If necessary, trigger lender callback.
        if (loan.callback) CoolerCallback(loan.lender).onRepay(loanID_, repaid_);
        return decollateralized;
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Interest should also be transferred to the lender when a borrower repays a loan.
