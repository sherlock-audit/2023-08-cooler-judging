# `emergency_shutdown` role is not enough for emergency shutdown.
## Summary

There are two protocol roles, `emergency_shutdown` and `cooler_overseer`. The `emergency_shutdown` should have the ability to shutdown the Clearinghouse.

However, in the current contract, `emergency_shutdown` role does not have said ability. An address will need both `emergency_shutdown` and `cooler_overseer` to perform said action.

We have also confirmed with the protocol team that the two roles will be held by two different multisigs, with the shutdown multisig having a lower threshold and more holders. Thereby governance will not be able to act as quickly to emergencies than expected.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's examine the function `emergencyShutdown()`:

```solidity 
function emergencyShutdown() external onlyRole("emergency_shutdown") {
    active = false;

    // If necessary, defund sDAI.
    uint256 sdaiBalance = sdai.balanceOf(address(this));
    if (sdaiBalance != 0) defund(sdai, sdaiBalance);

    // If necessary, defund DAI.
    uint256 daiBalance = dai.balanceOf(address(this));
    if (daiBalance != 0) defund(dai, daiBalance);

    emit Deactivated();
}
```

This has the modifier `onlyRole("emergency_shutdown")`. However, this also calls function `defund()`, which has the modifier `onlyRole("cooler_overseer")`

```solidity
function defund(ERC20 token_, uint256 amount_) public onlyRole("cooler_overseer") {
```

Therefore, the role `emergency_shutdown` will not have the ability to shutdown the protocol, unless it also has the overseer role.

### Proof of concept

To get a coded PoC, make the following modifications to the test case:
- In `Clearinghouse.t.sol`, comment out line 125 (so that `overseer` only has `emergency_shutdown` role)
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/test/Clearinghouse.t.sol#L125

```solidity
//rolesAdmin.grantRole("cooler_overseer", overseer);
rolesAdmin.grantRole("emergency_shutdown", overseer);
```

- Run the following test command (to just run a single test `test_emergencyShutdown()`):
```sh
forge test --match-test test_emergencyShutdown
```

The test will fail with the `ROLES_RequireRole()` error.
## Impact

`emergency_shutdown` role cannot emergency shutdown the protocol

## Tool used

Manual Review, Foundry/Forge

## Recommendation

Separate the logic for emergency shutdown and defunding. i.e. do not defund when emergency shutdown, but rather defund separately after shutdown. 

This will also have an additional impact of reducing centralization risk for that defunding requires a higher multisig threshold than shutdown.
