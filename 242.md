# Users requesting a loan does not get the loan
## Summary
Anyone can make a loan request via `requestLoan`. However, when a lender fills a loan via `clearRequest`, the debt tokens are sent to the Cooler owner and not the user that made the loan request. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The inline comment mentions the debt token gets transferred to the request owner, but it gets sent to the Cooler owner. 
```solidity
function requestLoan(..){
    ...
    // Transfer debt tokens to the owner of the request.
    debt().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, owner(), req.amount);
    ...
```

## Impact
User will not get the loan even if they deposited collateral.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
* option 1: Include the loan requestor address in the `Request` struct during `requestLoan` to ensure the debt tokens are sent to the actual requestor.
* option 2: If `requestLoan` is meant to be called only by the Cooler owner, restrict access to the owner with the following require statement:
```solidity
require(msg.sender == owner(), "Only the Cooler owner can make a loan request")
```
