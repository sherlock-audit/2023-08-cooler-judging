# `claimDefaulted()` can be call by anyone
## Summary

`claimDefaulted()` can be call by anyone

Let's assume this scenario:

Assuming that the lender does not want to take it back immediately because the collateral is falling, but wants to wait for the borrower to repay the debt, but the malicious party immediately executes the repayment after seeing the maturity, causing the lender to accept the collateral, because the collateral Things are falling, causing the lender to bear the loss

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    function claimDefaulted(uint256 loanID_) external returns (uint256, uint256, uint256) {
        Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];
        delete loans[loanID_];

        if (block.timestamp <= loan.expiry) revert NoDefault();

        // Transfer defaulted collateral to the lender.
        collateral().safeTransfer(loan.lender, loan.collateral);

        // Log the event.
        factory().newEvent(loanID_, CoolerFactory.Events.DefaultLoan, 0);

        // If necessary, trigger lender callback.
        if (loan.callback) CoolerCallback(loan.lender).onDefault(loanID_, loan.amount, loan.collateral);
        return (loan.amount, loan.collateral, block.timestamp - loan.expiry);
    }
```

This is Access Control Problem
Set `claimDefaulted()` only be call by `loan.lender`
