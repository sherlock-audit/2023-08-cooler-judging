# rollLoan accrues interest on debt that is not lent
## Summary
``rollLoan`` in ``Cooler`` compounds interest when calculating new debt.

## Vulnerability Detail
``rollLoan`` allows borrowers to accept new terms on their loan set by the lender. It adds on additional collateral and interest necessary to account for the added duration on the loan.

However, the interest is calculated on ``loan.amount`` which includes the interest that the borrower is repaying, but has not been lent.

Consider the following example where the borrower rolls a loan before repaying anything (no precision and using real numbers for simplicity).
``loan.amount = 1050`` (1000 borrowed + 50 interest (5% over 1 year))
Lender sets same terms, borrower rolls to increase loan duration
``newDebt = 1050 * 0.05 * 365 days / 365 days = 52.5 > 50``

The interest compounds despite Cooler loans being fixed simple interest loans (as seen in the calculation for ``interestFor``).

## Impact
User incurs more debt than they should when they roll loans.

## Recommendation
Consider caching loaned amount in a separate field and calculating new interest based off that.
