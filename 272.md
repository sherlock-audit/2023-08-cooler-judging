# New Loan terms can be rolled over during `repayLoan`
## Summary
If a debt token is a malicious ERC20 token that allows a callback during `debt().safeTransferFrom`, the `repayLoan` function can be re-entered during the following transfer and a new loan terms can be updated mid-way. 
```solidity
debt().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, repayTo, repaid_); // malicious callback to execute new loan terms
```

## Vulnerability Detail

`rollLoan` and `provideNewTermsForRoll` can be called after the re-entrancy to update the loan terms. 

## Impact
A new loan term can be updated during `repayLoan` execution which can modify the loan and collateral amount mid-way.

## Recommendation
Add OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard` or lock modifier to prevent re-entrancy during `repayLoan` and `rollLoan`
