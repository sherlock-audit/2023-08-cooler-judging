# Precision Loss and Unintended Reverts in repayLoan Function
## Summary
This vulnerability pertains to the repayLoan function, specifically in the calculation of the decollateralized value. Due to integer division, precision loss might occur, potentially leading to the calculation of a very small decollateralized value that rounds down to zero. This could result in unintended reverts when comparing the calculated value with zero.

## Vulnerability Detail
The repayLoan function, responsible for facilitating loan repayments, has a critical flaw that could lead to unintended reverts due to a precision loss issue. The vulnerability arises during the calculation of the decollateralized value, which might become very small due to integer division. Subsequently, when comparing this value with zero, unintended reverts could occur, impacting the normal flow of the repayment process.

if (loan.collateral * repaid_) is smaller and almost close to loan.amount, decollateralized would be rounded down to 0.
## Impact
Repayments that should be valid and accepted might revert erroneously 

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol#L159


    function repayLoan(uint256 loanID_, uint256 repaid_) external returns (uint256) {
        Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];

        if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) revert Default();

        if (repaid_ > loan.amount) repaid_ = loan.amount;

        uint256 decollateralized = (loan.collateral * repaid_) / loan.amount;
        if (decollateralized == 0) revert ZeroCollateralReturned();
       ...
       }

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
 Implement a custom library to handle decimals and arithmetic operations to prevent precision loss.
