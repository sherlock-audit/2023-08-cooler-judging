# Clearinghouse gOHM tokens theft via reward tokens in `claimDefaulted()` function by a self-lending Cooler contract attack
## Summary
The precious gOHM balance of the Clearinghouse contract can be decreased with a malicious contract Cooler which self-borrows and tricks the Clearinghouse with its stage. The detailed description is provided in this report.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `claimDefaulted()` in the Clearinghouse contract can be used to steal the Clearinghouse gOHM tokens silently. This function is designed to claim a reward for loan defaults. It calculates the auction rewards of a loan default and sends the corresponding rewards with gOHM to the `msg.sender`. The function is well-written and it checks all the needed parameters. However, it is vulnerable to state bypasses in the Cooler contract. Indeed, with some flash loans, which the process is discussed in detail in the preceding, we can trick the function parameters and steal the Clearinghouse gOHMs silently. The idea here is for the owner to lend himself and set a duration-less and interestless loan position or in other words, borrow from himself a loan. In this case, the owner, borrower, and lender becomes the attacker.
This attack requires two transactions, the second one should be performed after some time passes.

The first transaction (initiator tx):

Let's start from scratch and consider an attacker (Bob here) performs the preceding tasks:

1. He deploys a malicious contract which can integrate with the Cooler and CoolerFactory contracts
2. He gets some flash loans as WETH and swaps via [Uniswap v3 pair](https://etherscan.io/address/0xcf7e21b96a7dae8e1663b5a266fd812cbe973e70) to get some fresh gOHMs (gOHM final amount = 10e18)
3. He buys a tiny amount of DAI as well (10 wei)
4. He calls `generateCooler()` from the factory and creates a Cooler with the owner equal to Bob's contract. At this stage, he is the owner and the borrower. He also approves the Cooler contract to send DAI tokens on behalf of the attacker contract.
5. He then calls `requestLoan()` with these parameters (amount: 10, interest: 0, loanToCollateral: 1, duration 0). These parameters are accepted as there is no check for zero amounts. This function sends the collateral to the Cooler contract at the end.
6. This time he calls `clearRequest()` with the request-id which was generated in the previous level. In other words, he accepts to lend himself a loan and pays. Now, he is the owner, borrower, and lender!
7. He calls the function `provideNewTermsForRoll()` to re-activate the request of the previous level's loan ID. (to be able to get the collaterals back from the Cooler contract(
8. He calls the function `rescindRequest()`, and gets the collateral back, and empties the contract.
9. In the end, he pays back the flash loan.

An illustrative figure is provided here to clarify the attack procedure:

The second transaction (the complementary tx):

1. After some time passes, Bob gets 10 gOHM same as the second stage of the previous transaction.
2. He transfers the gOHM tokens to the Cooler contract.
3. He then calls the `claimDefaulted()` function in the Clearinghouse contract and thus, it will call `claimDefaulted()` of the Cooler and send the collateral back to the lender.
4. After sending the collaterals back, it calculates the corresponding rewards and sends them to Bob.
5. He gets some precious gOHM tokens out-of-thin-air
6. He pays back the flash loan

As it is described, this vulnerability arises from insufficient checks during requesting a loan, defaulting on a loan, and reactivating a request for the loan. These all lead the attacker to obtain free gOHM rewards. The point here is this attack can be repetitive and as time passes, he can repeat the second transaction and call the `claimDefaulted()` many times.

## Impact
The gOHM tokens of the Clearinghouse contract can be stolen through a flash-loan-based attack as time passes

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
For short-term mitigation, add a zero duration check inside the function `requestLoan` in the Cooler contract:

```Solidity
    function requestLoan(
        uint256 amount_,
        uint256 interest_,
        uint256 loanToCollateral_,
        uint256 duration_
    ) external returns (uint256 reqID) {

+       //Checking the loan duration not to be zero
+       require(duration_ != 0, "Zero duration not allowed!");

        reqID = requests.length;
        requests.push(
            Request({
                amount: amount_,
                interest: interest_,
                loanToCollateral: loanToCollateral_,
                duration: duration_,
                active: true
            })
        );

```

For Long-term solutions, consider putting restrictions on `provideNewTermsForRoll()` function in the Cooler contract to prevent flash loan attacks. Also, some restrictive checks should be considered in the Clearinghouse `claimDefaulted()` function.
