# Cooler.sol#interestFor() - possible rounding to 0 if loan/collateral ratio is too small
## Summary
The ``interestFor()`` function of the ``Cooler.sol`` is used to calculate the yearly interest on an active loan.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function does it's necessary calculations and rounds the equation, diving by ``DECIMALS_INTEREST`` which is 1e18. A possible problem is that the ``interest`` variable of a request is never checked against that 1e18 minimal value it has to have, thus the ``interestFor()`` function might round down to 0 for interest < 1e18 x amount x duration/365 days. 

## Impact
Borrow requests, that might get accidentally cleared by unsuspecting lenders, which would have 0 interest.

## Recommendation
Make sure the interest of new requests is at least 1e18, otherwise revert
