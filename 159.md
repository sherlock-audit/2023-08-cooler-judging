# `repayLoan()` will fail if the lender is blacklisted and this results in a guaranteed griefing attack on the collateral of a borrower
## Summary
The `repayLoan()` function allows borrowers to repay a loan.

In doing so `repayLoan()` attempts to transfer the debt token back to the lender. However, if the loan token implements a blacklist like the common USDC token, the lender can join the USDC blacklist to prevent the borrower from repaying (the `debt().safeTransferFrom` transfer will be impossible) and thus withdraw the borrower's collateral. 
So the borrower can be liquidated.

## Vulnerability Detail
#### Attack Scenario:
Consider we have:
- Borrower: Alice
- Lender: Bob

1. Alice (borrower) request the loan (via `requestLoan()` and transfer her collateral to the contract).
2. Bob (lender) accept the request loan (via `clearRequest()`) and set the `repayDirect_` parameter to true.
3. Bob calls approveTransfer() to approve transfer of loan ownership rights to a new blacklisted address of the token loan (USDC for example).
4. After that Bob immediately calls transferOwnership() to execute loan ownership transfer.
5. Alice wants to repay the loan, but since the new lender owner cannot receive USDC, the transaction fails.
6. After Alice (borrower) defaults, lender can withdraw lender's collateral via `claimDefaulted()` function.

## Impact
Any lender can prevent repayment of a loan and its liquidation. In particular, a lender can wait until a loan is almost completely repaid, transfer the loan to a blacklisted address (even one they do not control) to prevent the loan to be fully repaid / liquidated. The loan will default and borrower will not be able to withdraw their full amount of collateral.

This result in a guaranteed griefing attack on the collateral of a user.

I believe the impact is high since the griefing attack is always possible whenever the lent token implements a blacklist, and results in a guaranteed loss of collateral. This makes the borrower unable to repay the loan, resulting in liquidation.

## Code Snippet

Loan ownership transfering: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol#L338-L354
```solidity
    function approveTransfer(address to_, uint256 loanID_) external {
        if (msg.sender != loans[loanID_].lender) revert OnlyApproved();

        // Update transfer approvals.
        approvals[loanID_] = to_;
    }

    /// @notice Execute loan ownership transfer. Must be previously approved by the lender.
    /// @param  loanID_ index of loan in loans[].
    function transferOwnership(uint256 loanID_) external {
        if (msg.sender != approvals[loanID_]) revert OnlyApproved();

        // Update the load lender.
        loans[loanID_].lender = msg.sender;
        // Clear transfer approvals.
        approvals[loanID_] = address(0);
    }
```

Repaying: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol#L178
```solidity
    function repayLoan(
        uint256 loanID_,
        uint256 repaid_
    ) external returns (uint256) {
        ...

        // Transfer repaid debt back to the lender and (de)collateral back to the owner.
        debt().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, repayTo, repaid_);
        
        ...
    }
```

Liquidation: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol#L318-L333
```solidity
    function claimDefaulted(
        uint256 loanID_
    ) external returns (uint256, uint256, uint256) {
        Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];
        delete loans[loanID_];

        if (block.timestamp <= loan.expiry) revert NoDefault();

        // Transfer defaulted collateral to the lender.
        collateral().safeTransfer(loan.lender, loan.collateral);

        // Log the event.
        factory().newEvent(loanID_, CoolerFactory.Events.DefaultLoan, 0);

        // If necessary, trigger lender callback.
        if (loan.callback)
            CoolerCallback(loan.lender).onDefault(
                loanID_,
                loan.amount,
                loan.collateral
            );
        return (loan.amount, loan.collateral, block.timestamp - loan.expiry);
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider modifying the logic so that when a loan is repaid or liquidated, the lendingToken is sent to the contract first, allowing the lender to claim it at a later time. This would remove the need for the repayDirect_ option.
