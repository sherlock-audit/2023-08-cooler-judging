# [H-01] Front-Running New Roll Terms' Interest Rate
## Summary

Vulnerability related to front-running a borrower's transaction and forcing him to take on a terrible interest rate.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol#L282) `provideNewTermsForRoll()` in `Cooler.sol` gives us the opportunity to propose new terms for an existing `loanID`:
```javascript
function provideNewTermsForRoll(
        uint256 loanID_,
        uint256 interest_,
        uint256 loanToCollateral_,
        uint256 duration_
    ) external {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanID_];

        if (msg.sender != loan.lender) revert OnlyApproved();

        loan.request =
            Request(
                loan.amount,
                interest_,
                loanToCollateral_,
                duration_,
                true
            );
    }
```

Where `loanID` specifices the index of the existing loan. Here we can propose a new interest rate, loanToCollateral & duration.

The borrower can review the new terms and [call](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol#L192) `rollLoan()` to accept the roll as long as the `block.timestamp > loan.expiry` and `loan.request.active == true` (which is set to true when proposing new roll terms).
```javascript
function rollLoan(uint256 loanID_) external {
        Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];

        if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) revert Default();
        if (!loan.request.active) revert NotRollable();

        // Check whether rolling the loan requires pledging more collateral or not (if there was a previous repayment).
        uint256 newCollateral = newCollateralFor(loanID_);
        uint256 newDebt = interestFor(loan.amount, loan.request.interest, loan.request.duration);

        // Update memory accordingly.
        loan.amount += newDebt;
        loan.collateral += newCollateral;
        loan.expiry += loan.request.duration;
        loan.request.active = false;

        // Save updated loan info in storage.
        loans[loanID_] = loan;

        if (newCollateral > 0) {
            collateral().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newCollateral);
        }

        // If necessary, trigger lender callback.
        if (loan.callback) CoolerCallback(loan.lender).onRoll(loanID_, newDebt, newCollateral);
    }
```

The issue stems from the fact that the lender (attacker) can front-run ther borrower's call to `rollLoan()` and change the conditions for the loan to a much higher interest rate than first proposed, forcing the borrower into a terrible loan. Since we are not proposing a new `loanID` but rather overwriting data on the existing one, the borrower's call goes through and he accepts the malicious attack conditions. Since there is no cap on interest rate this is especially problematic.

Order of attack:

1. A cooler is generated for e.g. a USDC/USDT debt/collateral pair.
2. Borrower requests a loan and malicious lender clears the request.
3. Some time passes and malicious lender proposes new, favorable conditions with low interest rate and extended loan duration.
4. Borrower is happy to agree on the new conditions and calls `rollLoan()`.
5. Malicious lender monitors the mempool and front-runs the borrower, changing the loan conditions to a much higher interest rate for the same `loanID`.
6. Borrower's transaction goes through and he accepts the new malicious loan conditions.
7. Borrower is stuck with bad loan and might be forced to default on it.
## Impact
Borrower is forced to accept bad conditions for his loan and cannot do anything about it, might also lead to the loan defaulting.

## Tool used

VSCode, Manual Review

## Recommendation

One way to solve this would be to implement a sort of time-lock mechanism that does not allow the lender to change the loan conditions for a set period of time after proposing new ones once. Although it would still be technically possible if the borrower is slow to accept the new terms, it makes it much less likely.
