# Insufficient validation on duration can cause Borrower loss.
## Summary
In ```requestLoan()```, ```duration_``` paramter is not checked for zero, opening doors for Borrowers to make errors and get their loans defaulted.

## Vulnerability Detail
It is not common to take loan for 0 seconds.
When requesting a loan through ```requestLoan()```, the value for parameter ```duration_``` is not checked for zero.
If such a loan is requested where ```duration = 0 ``` by mistake, then the loan will immediately get defaulted, causing Borrower to lose collateral token.

Example:
1 - Borrower creates a loan request with ```duration_ = 0``` by mistake.
2 - Lender immediately call clearRequest() to give loan.
3 - Lender then calls ```claimDefaulted()``` as the loan was for 0 seconds that has passed,

## Impact
Borrower loses collateral tokens due to a mistake that could have been stopped by proper input validation.
Occurrence of the issue requires a mistake from borrower, hence marking as medium.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function requestLoan(
        uint256 amount_,
        uint256 interest_,
        uint256 loanToCollateral_,
        uint256 duration_
    ) external returns (uint256 reqID) {
        reqID = requests.length;
        requests.push(
            Request({
                amount: amount_,
                interest: interest_,
                loanToCollateral: loanToCollateral_,
                duration: duration_, // @audit
                active: true
            })
        );
....
}

```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Just put a check like below before setting the duration value:
```require(duration_!=0,"Invalid duration");```
