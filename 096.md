# [M-01] Missing check in Cooler::requestLoan() can cause lose of funds for users.
## Summary

Funds can be lost from users who are not the owner() of the contract due to missing check.

## Vulnerability Detail

In [Cooler.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol) the [Cooler::requestLoan](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/6d34cd12a2a15d2c92307d44782d6eae1474ab25/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol#L98C5-L125C6) function, the `collateral` is transferred from the `msg.sender` instead of `owner()` . There is no check to see if the user calling the function is the owner(). And if the request is accepted by the lender, debt is transferred to the owner(), and after repayment, the collateral is transferred back to the owner(). But if any user who is not the owner() sends a request, the collateral will be deducted from them and they wont get it back.

## Impact

User's tokens are deducted and are lost for ever.

## Code Snippet

```javascript
File:: Cooler.sol
         // The collateral is taken upfront. Will be escrowed
        // until the loan is repaid or defaulted.
       // @audit-issue collateral is taken from msg.sender
        collateral().safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender, //@audit-issue should be from owner().//check msg.sender != owner
            address(this),
            collateralFor(amount_, loanToCollateral_)
        );
```
```javascript
File:: Cooler.sol
//In Cooler::clearRequest()

       // Transfer debt tokens to the owner of the request.
        debt().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, owner(), req.amount);

//In Cooler::repayLoan()

         collateral().safeTransfer(owner(), decollateralized); //collateral is returned back to owner
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In Cooler::requestLoan() make a check to see the caller is the owner.
```javascript
 if (msg.sender != owner()) revert OnlyApproved();
```
