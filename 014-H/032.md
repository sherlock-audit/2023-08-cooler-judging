# Lack of  validation in claimDefaulted allows keepers to arbitrarily steal and burn gOHM
## Summary
Lack of validation in ``claimDefaulted`` in ``Clearinghouse`` that the lender of the loan to liquidate is ``Clearinghouse`` allows keepers to arbitrarily steal gOHM from ``Clearinghouse``, burn gOHM, and distort accounting.

## Vulnerability Detail
[``claimDefaulted``](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/6d34cd12a2a15d2c92307d44782d6eae1474ab25/Cooler/src/Clearinghouse.sol#L191-L245) allows callers to batch collection of collateral on defaulted loans to the ``Clearinghouse``. It assumes that the Coolers' configuration matches the one defined in the ``Clearinghouse``.

However, it does not validate that this is the case, only checking that the Cooler address provided is registered and deployed from the permissioned factory (all valid Coolers). Consequently, keepers can call ``claimDefaulted`` on Coolers and loans with any configuration and still receive rewards on the collateral amount (any accounting will be wrong due to the function assuming the configuration matches).  This can be used to arbitrarily steal gOHM from the ``Clearinghouse``.

Consider the following example:
- Alice creates Cooler with debt token DAI, collateral token BUSD
- She calls ``requestLoan`` with ``amount_ = 2e18``, ``interest_ = 0``, ``loanToCollateral_ = 1e18``, ``duration_ = 0``, depositing 2e18 BUSD as collateral
- She clears her own request using an address that implements CoolerCallback lending 2e18 DAI to herself (she implements ``onDefault`` such that it always reverts until after 7 days to stop anyone calling ``claimDefaulted`` on her loan)
- She waits 7 days
- She calls ``claimDefaulted`` on ``Clearinghouse`` with her Cooler address and loanId (note that even if a keeper executes this before she does, she doesn't actually lose any funds apart from gas fees since she lent to herself)
- Calculating the reward,
``collateral = 2e18`` (since nothing was repaid)
``maxAuctionReward = 2e18 * 5e16 / 1e18 = 1e17``
``maxReward = 1e17`` (since 7 days have passed)
``keeperRewards = 1e17``

Alice receives 1e17 gOHM and loses nothing. Multiple loans can be created and executed in a batch in the same way to drain the ``Clearinghouse`` of all gOHM it holds for rewarding keepers.

## Impact
Draining of gOHM provided to ``Clearinghouse``.
Other impacts include breaking of accounting in ``receivables`` and treasury debt, and unaccounted for unstaking and burning of gOHM.

## Recommendation
Validate that the lender of loans provided is ``Clearinghouse`` in ``claimDefaulted``.
