# Malicious lenders could force borrowers to give up their collateral by adjusting interest rate in Cooler contract
## Summary
Malicious lenders could force borrowers to give up their collateral by adjusting interest rate in Cooler contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
Because rollLoan() can be called by anyone, a malicious lender could just provide a new term with unfair interest rate to force borrowers to either pay huge amount of debt or give up their collateral.
Consider this scenario:
- A borrower makes a new loan request with good ratio for lenders.
- A malicious lender prefers to get borrower's collateral instead of getting paid back.
- The lender will first clear the request, and then provide new a term with significantly high interest rate. After that, they roll loan over.
- Now the borrower have to either pay a huge amount of debt token or give up their collateral.
## Impact
Lenders have unfair advantage over borrowers because they could adjust interest rate as much as they want.
