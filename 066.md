# Calling Cooler.claimDefaulted will lose all unclaimed payments.
## Summary
Loans not using repayDirect (`repayDirect = false`) must call `Cooler.claimRepaid` to get their unclaimed debt payments.
However, if someone calls `Cooler.claimDefaulted` first, `loan.unclaimed` is set to `0` wiping any ability to claim them.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Alice calls `Cooler.clearRequest` with `repayDirect` set to `false`
2. Bob, who made the `loanRequest` pays back the loan in time.
3. The time for the loan runs out
4. Charles calls `Cooler.claimDefaulted` on that loan
5. Alice calls `claimRepaid` and gets zero tokens.

Note that it is possible to call both `Cooler.claimDefaulted` and `Clearinghouse.claimDefaulted` on loans that have been fully repaid.

## Impact
Lenders using `repayDirect = false ` will likely lose all debt payments.
Two likely scenarios
1. **Defaulted loans that have received some payments**
The lender will only get the remaining collateral and not any payments _(if they don't call `claimRepaid` first)_.
2. **Loans that are paid back, but the lender does not claim the payments before the expiry date.**
In this scenario, the lender will lose all payments

Even without malicious intent, unclaimed loans will be wiped when someone calls `ClearingHouse.claimDefaulted`, which is encouraged.

**Cooler.claimDefaulted**
```solidity
    /// @notice Claim collateral upon loan default.
    /// @param loanID_ index of loan in loans[]
    /// @return defaulted debt by the borrower, collateral kept by the lender, elapsed time since expiry.
    function claimDefaulted(uint256 loanID_) external returns (uint256, uint256, uint256) {
        Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];
        delete loans[loanID_]; //<--- @audit removes all information on loan

        if (block.timestamp <= loan.expiry) revert NoDefault();

        // Transfer defaulted collateral to the lender.
        collateral().safeTransfer(loan.lender, loan.collateral); // <---- @audit only loan.collateral, loan.unclaimed can be non-0 at this point

        // Log the event.
        factory().newEvent(loanID_, CoolerFactory.Events.DefaultLoan, 0);

        // If necessary, trigger lender callback.
        if (loan.callback) CoolerCallback(loan.lender).onDefault(loanID_, loan.amount, loan.collateral);
        return (loan.amount, loan.collateral, block.timestamp - loan.expiry);
    }
```

```solidity
    /// @notice Claim debt tokens if repayDirect was false.
    /// @param  loanID_ index of loan in loans[].
    function claimRepaid(uint256 loanID_) external {
        Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];

        // Update storage.
        uint256 claim = loan.unclaimed; // <--- @audit This value is always zero after claimDefaulted has been called successfully. 
        delete loans[loanID_].unclaimed;

        // Transfer repaid debt back to the lender.
        debt().safeTransfer(loan.lender, claim);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`Cooler.claimDefaulted` should send along `loan.unclaimed` before wiping the loan.
