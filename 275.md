# clearRequest reentracy

## Summary
clearRequest reentracy

## Vulnerability Detail
By using this line
`!CoolerCallback(msg.sender).isCoolerCallback()`
lender can re-entrancy attack on clearRequest, resulting making multiple loans for single request

## Impact
When lender calls claimDefault for these multiple loans, he can receive multiplied collateral amount.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
   function clearRequest(
        uint256 reqID_,
        bool repayDirect_,
        bool isCallback_
    ) external returns (uint256 loanID) {
        Request memory req = requests[reqID_];

        // If necessary, ensure lender implements the CoolerCallback abstract.
        if (isCallback_ && !CoolerCallback(msg.sender).isCoolerCallback()) revert NotCoolerCallback();

        // Ensure loan request is active. 
        if (!req.active) revert Deactivated();

        // Clear the loan request in memory.
        req.active = false;

        // Calculate and store loan terms.
        uint256 interest = interestFor(req.amount, req.interest, req.duration);
        uint256 collat = collateralFor(req.amount, req.loanToCollateral);
        uint256 expiration = block.timestamp + req.duration;
        loanID = loans.length;
        loans.push(
            Loan({
                request: req,
                amount: req.amount + interest,
                unclaimed: 0,
                collateral: collat,
                expiry: expiration,
                lender: msg.sender,
                repayDirect: repayDirect_,
                callback: isCallback_
            })
        );

        // Clear the loan request storage.
        requests[reqID_].active = false;

        // Transfer debt tokens to the owner of the request.
        debt().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, owner(), req.amount);

        // Log the event.
        factory().newEvent(reqID_, CoolerFactory.Events.ClearRequest, 0);
    }
