# Issue H-1: Can steal gOhm by calling Clearinghouse.claimDefaulted on loans not made by Clearinghouse 

Source: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler-judging/issues/28 

## Found by

`Clearinghouse.claimDefaulted` assumes that all loans passed in were originated by the Clearinghouse. However, nothing guarantees that. An attacker can wreak havoc by calling it with a mixture of Clearinghouse-originated and external loans. In particular, they can inflate the computed `totalCollateral` recovered to steal excess gOhm from defaulted loans.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. Alice creates a Cooler. 9 times, she calls `requestLoan` (not through the Clearinghouse) to request a loan of 0.000001 DAI collateralized by 2 gOhm. For each loan, she then calls `clearLoan` and loans the 0.000001 DAI to herself.
1. One week later, Bob calls `Clearinghouse.lendToCooler` and takes a loan for 3000 DAI collateralized by 1 gOHM
3. Alice defaults on the loans she made to herself and waits 7 days
4. Bob defaults on his loan
5. Alice calls `Clearinghouse.claimDefaulted`, passing in both her loans to herself and Bob's loan from the Clearinghouse. `Clearinghouse.claimDefaulted` calls `Cooler.claimDefaulted` on each, returning 18 gOhm to Alice and 1 gOhm to the Clearinghouse.
6. For each of Alice's loan, the keeper reward is incremented by the max award of 0.1 gOhm. For Bob's loan, the keeper reward is incremented by somewhere between 0 and 0.05 gOhm,  depending on how much time has elapsed since Bob's loan defaulted. 
8. The keeper reward is transferred to Alice. Alice's reward will be between 0.9 and 0.95 gOhm, but it should be between 0 and 0.05 gOhm. The contract should recover between 0.95 and 1 gOhm, but it only recovers between 0.05 and 0.1 gOhm.  Alice has effectively stolen 0.9 gOhm from the contract

The attack as stated above can steal at most 5% of the collateral. **Note that Alice can get this even without waiting 7 days from loan expiry time.** It further requires the Clearinghouse have some extra gOhm around, as it will burn `totalCollateral - keeperRewards`. This can happen if the treasury or someone sends it some gOhm for some reason, or by calling claimDefault as in #3 .

However, #5  extends this attack so that Alice can steal 100% of the collateral, even if the Clearinghouse has no extra gOhm lying around.

For added fun, note that, when setting up her loans to herself, Alice can set the loan duration to 0 seconds. So this only requires setting up 1 block in advance.

## Impact

Anyone can steal collateral from defaulted loans.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Clearinghouse.sol#L191

Notice the lack of any checks that the loan's lender is the Clearingouse

```solidity
    function claimDefaulted(address[] calldata coolers_, uint256[] calldata loans_) external {
        uint256 loans = loans_.length;
        if (loans != coolers_.length) revert LengthDiscrepancy();

        uint256 totalDebt;
        uint256 totalInterest;
        uint256 totalCollateral;
        uint256 keeperRewards;
        for (uint256 i=0; i < loans;) {
            // Validate that cooler was deployed by the trusted factory.
            if (!factory.created(coolers_[i])) revert OnlyFromFactory();
            
            // Claim defaults and update cached metrics.
            (uint256 debt, uint256 collateral, uint256 elapsed) = Cooler(coolers_[i]).claimDefaulted(loans_[i]);
```

`keeperRewards` is incremented for every loan.

```solidity
            // Cap rewards to 5% of the collateral to avoid OHM holder's dillution.
            uint256 maxAuctionReward = collateral * 5e16 / 1e18;
            // Cap rewards to avoid exorbitant amounts.
            uint256 maxReward = (maxAuctionReward < MAX_REWARD)
                ? maxAuctionReward
                : MAX_REWARD;
            // Calculate rewards based on the elapsed time since default.
            keeperRewards = (elapsed < 7 days)
                ? keeperRewards + maxReward * elapsed / 7 days
                : keeperRewards + maxReward;
        }
```

`Cooler.claimDefaulted` can be called by anyone.

```solidity

        Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];
        delete loans[loanID_];

       // Hey look, no checks on sender
}

`claimDefaulted` does not handle `loan.unclaimed`  . This preventing the lender from receiving the debt repayment.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
function claimDefaulted(uint256 loanID_) external returns (uint256, uint256, uint256) {
  Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];
  delete loans[loanID_];
```

 Loan data is deletead in `claimDefaulted` function. `loan.unclaimed` is not checked before data deletead. So, if `claimDefaulted` is called while there are unclaimed tokens, the lender will not be able to get the unclaimed tokens.

## Impact

Lender cannot get unclaimed token.

`Clearinghouse` doesn't approve the `MINTR` to handle tokens in his name, which bricks the entire function.

## Vulnerability Detail
Inside `claimDefaulted` on the [last line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/6d34cd12a2a15d2c92307d44782d6eae1474ab25/Cooler/src/Clearinghouse.sol#L244) we call `MINTR.burnOhm` which in turn calls [OHM.burnFrom](https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-v3/blob/19236eb1c02464df8fb79c7b59b7195d7511b338/src/modules/MINTR/OlympusMinter.sol#L50-L61). The [docs for MINTR.burnFrom](https://docs.olympusdao.finance/main/technical/contract-docs/modules/MINTR/OlympusMinter/#burnohm) state: "Burn OHM from an address. Must have approval.". We can confirm that this is the case when looking at `OHM` source code and it's `burnFrom`. I found 2 `OHM` tokens that are currently deployed on mainnet, so I'm linking both their addresses: https://etherscan.io/token/0x383518188c0c6d7730d91b2c03a03c837814a899#code, https://etherscan.io/token/0x64aa3364f17a4d01c6f1751fd97c2bd3d7e7f1d5#code. Both addresses use the same `burnFrom` logic and in both cases they require an `allowance`. Nowhere in the contract do we approve the `MINTR` to handle `OHM` tokens in the name of `Clearinghouse`, in fact `OHM` isn't even specified in `Clearinghouse`.  

Side note:
The test `testFuzz_claimDefaulted` succeeds, because `MockOhm` is written incorrectly. When `burnFrom` gets called `MockOhm` calls the inherited `_burn` function, which burns tokens from `msg.sender`. The mock doesn't represent how the real `OHM.burnFrom` works.
## Impact
`Claimdefault` will always revert.

Add a variable `ohm` which will be the `OHM` address and approve the necessary tokens to the `MINTR` before calling `MINTR.burnOhm`.

Seems real

Confirmed, but disagree with the severity.
Defaults could still happen via the Cooler contracts and OHM could be burned ad-hoc by the DAO.

# Issue H-4: isCoolerCallback can be bypassed

The lender can bypass `CoolerCallback.isCoolerCallback()` validation without implements the `CoolerCallback` abstract.

In the provided example, this may force the loan to default.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `CoolerCallback.isCoolerCallback()` is intended to ensure that the lender implements the `CoolerCallback` abstract at line 241 when the parameter `isCallback_` is `true`.

```solidity=!
function clearRequest(
    uint256 reqID_,
    bool repayDirect_,
    bool isCallback_
) external returns (uint256 loanID) {
    Request memory req = requests[reqID_];

    // If necessary, ensure lender implements the CoolerCallback abstract.
    if (isCallback_ && !CoolerCallback(msg.sender).isCoolerCallback()) revert NotCoolerCallback();

    // Ensure loan request is active. 
    if (!req.active) revert Deactivated();

    // Clear the loan request in memory.
    req.active = false;

    // Calculate and store loan terms.
    uint256 interest = interestFor(req.amount, req.interest, req.duration);
    uint256 collat = collateralFor(req.amount, req.loanToCollateral);
    uint256 expiration = block.timestamp + req.duration;
    loanID = loans.length;
    loans.push(
        Loan({
            request: req,
            amount: req.amount + interest,
            unclaimed: 0,
            collateral: collat,
            expiry: expiration,
            lender: msg.sender,
            repayDirect: repayDirect_,
            callback: isCallback_
        })
    );

    // Clear the loan request storage.
    requests[reqID_].active = false;

    // Transfer debt tokens to the owner of the request.
    debt().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, owner(), req.amount);

    // Log the event.
    factory().newEvent(reqID_, CoolerFactory.Events.ClearRequest, 0);
}
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol#L233-L275

However, this function doesn't provide any protection. The lender can bypass this check without implementing the `CoolerCallback` abstract by calling the `Cooler.clearRequest()` function using a contract that implements the `isCoolerCallback()` function and returns a `true` value.

For example:

```solidity=!
contract maliciousLender {
    function isCoolerCallback() pure returns(bool) {
        return true;
    }
    
    function operation(
        address _to,
        uint256 reqID_
    ) public {
        Cooler(_to).clearRequest(reqID_, true, true);
    }
    
    function onDefault(uint256 loanID_, uint256 debt, uint256 collateral) public {}
}
```

By being the `loan.lender` with implement only `onDefault()` function, this will cause the `repayLoan()` and `rollLoan()` methods to fail due to revert at `onRepay()` and `onRoll()` function. The borrower cannot repay and the loan will be defaulted.

After the loan default, the attacker can execute `claimDefault()` to claim the collateral.

Furthermore, there is another method that allows lenders to bypass the `CoolerCallback.isCoolerCallback()` function which is loan ownership transfer.

```solidity=!
/// @notice Approve transfer of loan ownership rights to a new address.
/// @param  to_ address to be approved.
/// @param  loanID_ index of loan in loans[].
function approveTransfer(address to_, uint256 loanID_) external {
    if (msg.sender != loans[loanID_].lender) revert OnlyApproved();

    // Update transfer approvals.
    approvals[loanID_] = to_;
}

/// @notice Execute loan ownership transfer. Must be previously approved by the lender.
/// @param  loanID_ index of loan in loans[].
function transferOwnership(uint256 loanID_) external {
    if (msg.sender != approvals[loanID_]) revert OnlyApproved();

    // Update the load lender.
    loans[loanID_].lender = msg.sender;
    // Clear transfer approvals.
    approvals[loanID_] = address(0);
}
```

Normally, the lender who implements the `CoolerCallback` abstract may call the `Cooler.clearRequest()` with the `_isCoolerCallback` parameter set to `true` to execute logic when a loan is repaid, rolled, or defaulted.

But the lender needs to change the owner of the loan, so they call the `approveTransfer()` and `transferOwnership()` functions to the contract that doesn't implement the `CoolerCallback` abstract (or implement only `onDefault()` function to force the loan default), but the `loan.callback` flag is still set to `true`.

Thus, this breaks the business logic since the three callback functions don't need to be implemented when the `isCoolerCallback()` is set to `true` according to the dev note in the `CoolerCallback` abstract below:

> /// @notice Allows for debt issuers to execute logic when a loan is repaid, rolled, or defaulted.
/// @dev    The three callback functions must be implemented if `isCoolerCallback()` is set to true.

## Impact

1. The lender forced the Loan become default to get the collateral token, owner lost the collateral token.

2. Bypass the `isCoolerCallback` validation.

# Issue M-1: `emergency_shutdown` role is not enough for emergency shutdown. 

Source: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler-judging/issues/1 

## Found by 
thekmj, ubermensch

There are two protocol roles, `emergency_shutdown` and `cooler_overseer`. The `emergency_shutdown` should have the ability to shutdown the Clearinghouse.

However, in the current contract, `emergency_shutdown` role does not have said ability. An address will need both `emergency_shutdown` and `cooler_overseer` to perform said action.

We have also confirmed with the protocol team that the two roles will be held by two different multisigs, with the shutdown multisig having a lower threshold and more holders. Thereby governance will not be able to act as quickly to emergencies than expected.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's examine the function `emergencyShutdown()`:

```solidity 
function emergencyShutdown() external onlyRole("emergency_shutdown") {
    active = false;

    // If necessary, defund sDAI.
    uint256 sdaiBalance = sdai.balanceOf(address(this));
    if (sdaiBalance != 0) defund(sdai, sdaiBalance);

    // If necessary, defund DAI.
    uint256 daiBalance = dai.balanceOf(address(this));
    if (daiBalance != 0) defund(dai, daiBalance);

    emit Deactivated();
}
```

This has the modifier `onlyRole("emergency_shutdown")`. However, this also calls function `defund()`, which has the modifier `onlyRole("cooler_overseer")`

```solidity
function defund(ERC20 token_, uint256 amount_) public onlyRole("cooler_overseer") {
```

Therefore, the role `emergency_shutdown` will not have the ability to shutdown the protocol, unless it also has the overseer role.

### Proof of concept

To get a coded PoC, make the following modifications to the test case:
- In `Clearinghouse.t.sol`, comment out line 125 (so that `overseer` only has `emergency_shutdown` role)
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/test/Clearinghouse.t.sol#L125

```solidity
//rolesAdmin.grantRole("cooler_overseer", overseer);
rolesAdmin.grantRole("emergency_shutdown", overseer);
```

- Run the following test command (to just run a single test `test_emergencyShutdown()`):
```sh
forge test --match-test test_emergencyShutdown
```

The test will fail with the `ROLES_RequireRole()` error.
## Impact

`emergency_shutdown` role cannot emergency shutdown the protocol

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Clearinghouse.sol#L360-L372

## Tool used

Manual Review, Foundry/Forge

## Recommendation

There are two ways to mitigate this issue:
- Separate the logic for emergency shutdown and defunding. i.e. do not defund when emergency shutdown, but rather defund separately after shutdown. 
- Move the defunding logic to a separate internal function, so that emergency shutdown function can directly call defunding without going through a modifier.

# Issue M-2: Lender is able to steal borrowers collateral by calling rollLoan  with unfavourable terms on behalf of the borrower.

A Lender is able to call provideNewTermsForRoll with whatever terms they want and then can call rollLoan on behalf of the borrower forcing them to roll the loan with the terms they provided. They can abuse this to make the loan so unfavourable for the borrower to repay that they must forfeit their collateral to the lender.

## Vulnerability Detail
Say a user has 100 collateral tokens valued at $1,500 and they wish to borrow 1,000 debt tokens valued at $1,000 they would would call: (values have simplified for ease of math)
```Solidity
requestLoan("1,000 debt tokens", "5% interest", "10 loan tokens for each collateral", "1 year")
```
If a lender then clears the request the borrower would expect to have 1 year to payback 1,050 debt tokens to be able to receive their collateral back.

However a lender is able to call provideNewTermsForRoll with whatever terms they wish: i.e. 
```Solidity
provideNewTermsForRoll("loanID", "10000000% interest", "1000 loan tokens for each collateral" , "1 year")
```
They can then follow this up with a call to rollLoan(loanID):
During the rollLoan function  the interest is recalculated using:
```Solidity
    function interestFor(uint256 amount_, uint256 rate_, uint256 duration_) public pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 interest = (rate_ * duration_) / 365 days;
        return (amount_ * interest) / DECIMALS_INTEREST;
    }
```
As rate_ & duration_ are controllable by the borrower when they call provideNewTermsForRoll they can input a large number that the amount returned is much larger then the value of the collateral.  i.e. input a rate_ of amount * 3 and duration of 365 days so that the interestFor returns 3,000.

This amount gets added to the existing [loan.amount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol#L203) and would make it too costly to ever repay as the borrower would have to spend more then the collateral is worth to get it back. i.e. borrower now would now need to send 4,050 debt tokens to receive their $1,500 worth of collateral back instead of the expected 1050.

The extra amount should result in more collateral needing to be sent however it is calculated using loan.request.loanToCollateral which is also controlled by the lender when they call provideNewTermsForRoll,  allowing them to input a value that will result in newCollateralFor returning 0 and no new collateral needing to be sent.

```Solidity
    function newCollateralFor(uint256 loanID_) public view returns (uint256) {
        Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];
        // Accounts for all outstanding debt (borrowed amount + interest).
        uint256 neededCollateral = collateralFor(loan.amount, loan.request.loanToCollateral);  
        // Lender can force neededCollateral to always be less than loan.collateral

        return neededCollateral > loan.collateral ? neededCollateral - loan.collateral : 0;
    }
```
As a result a borrower who was expecting to have repay 1050 tokens to get back their collateral may now need to spend many multiples more of that and will just be forced to just forfeit their collateral to the lender. 


## Impact
Borrower will be forced to payback the loan at unfavourable terms or forfeit their collateral.

# Issue M-3: gOhm stuck forever if call claimDefaulted on Cooler directly 

Source: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler-judging/issues/46 

## Found by 
castle\_chain, evilakela, jkoppel

Anyone can call Cooler.claimDefaulted. If this is done for a loan owned by the Clearinghouse, the gOhm is sent to the Clearinghouse, but there is no way to recover or burn it.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. Bob calls `Clearinghouse.lendToCooler` to make a loan collateralized by 1000 gOhm.
2. Bob defaults on the loan
3.  Immediately after default, Eve calls `Cooler.claimDefaulted` on Bob's loan.
4. The gOhm is transferred to the Clearinghouse
5. There is no way to burn or transfer it. (In fact,  `defund()` can be used to transfer literally any token *except* gOhm back to the treasury.)

However, the gOhm can now be stolen using the exploit in #1, potentially in the same transaction as when Eve called `Cooler.claimDefaulted()`.

## Impact

Anyone can very easily make all defaulted gOhm get stuck forever.

## Code Snippet

`Cooler.claimDefaulted` sends the collateral to the lender, calls `onDefault`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol#L325

`Clearinghouse.onDefault` does nothing

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Clearinghouse.sol#L265

Although `Clearinghouse.defund()` can be used to send any other token back to the treasury, it cannot do so for gOhm

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Clearinghouse.sol#L340

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Unsure. Perhaps add a flag disabling claiming by anyone other than `loan.lender`? Or just allow `defund()` to be called on gOhm?




## Discussion

**jkoppel**

This is not a duplicate of #28. #28 involves Clearinghouse.claimDefaulted, but this involves Cooler.claimDefaulted.

**Oot2k**

Not a duplicate

**0xRusowsky**

Despite it is not a duplicate, since gOHM would be stuck in CH instead of the being OHM burn. It wouldn't be a big deal (we could ammend the calculations based on that) because it doesn't have any operational/economical impact as long as that supply is removed from the backing calculations.

On top of that, there is an economical incentive to call it from the CH, as the caller is rewarded.

Disagree with severity, imo at max it should be a medium.

Will think about how to deal with it.
