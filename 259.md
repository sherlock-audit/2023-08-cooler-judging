# Lender can lose out on interest when decimal of debt token is low
## Summary

Calculation of interest can be round down to zero in case the debt token's decimals are very low.

## Vulnerability Detail

`interestFor` function is used to calculate the interest amount for the Loan.

```solidity
File: Cooler.sol

    function interestFor(uint256 amount_, uint256 rate_, uint256 duration_) public pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 interest = (rate_ * duration_) / 365 days;
        return (amount_ * interest) / DECIMALS_INTEREST;
    }

```

This function is used in `clearRequest` and `rollLoan` to add the interest value in the loan `amount` which the borrower needs to repay.

Consider the following Scenario:

1. Alice deployed a Cooler for `GUSD/WETH`.

2. Note that `GUSD` has only 2 decimals.

3. Consider the request parameters: 
    * rate = `1e15`
    * amount = `500` GUSD
    * duration = `7 days` = `604800 seconds`

In this situation,

* `interest` = `1e15 * 604800 / 365 days`
  `interest` = `19e12`
* `returning Interest Amount` = `50000 * 19e12 / 1e18`
  `returning Interest Amount` = `0` (because of Rounding Down)

In this situation, Lender will not get any interest.

## Impact

Loss of interest for Lender.

## Recommendation

Add a condition to revert when `rate_ != 0` and return value of `interestFor` is zero.
