# Overflow in totalCollateral allows attacker to steal 100% of collateral returned to Clearinghouse, just 1 second after loan expiry
## Summary

It is possible for an attacker to steal all collateral returned to the Clearinghouse by calling `Clearinghouse.claimDefaulted`, passing in non-Cooler originated loans for multiple attacker-controlled tokens that cause `totalCollateral` to overflow.

## Vulnerability Detail

This is an extension of #1. The attack in #1  allows an attacker to steal up to 5% of the collateral returned to the Clearinghouse, and requires that some other mechanism cause stray gOhm to be there.

This issue shows a way that the attacker can steal 100% of the collateral, and which does not require that the Clearinghouse have extra gOhm lying around. Because `Clearinghouse.claimDefaulted` also does not check the currency of the loan,  the attacker Alice can pass into `claimDefaulted` a loan she made to herself collateralized by `2**256-1` of some made-up token. This will cause `totalCollateral` to overflow in the unchecked block, while adding exactly 0.1 gOhm to her reward.  By overflowing `totalCollateral` Alice can carefully manipulate parameters so that `totalCollateral` exactly equals `keeperRewards`, thereby taking approximately 100% of the collateral due to the Clearinghouse.

By setting the loans to herself to have a duration of 0 seconds,  this only requires setup 1 block in advance.

**Note on submission**: This attack is very arguably a duplicate of #1. However, I am submitting it as separate because it is both far worse than the attack in #1 and also harder to discover. I am not sure how best to treat the question of whether these are duplicates, but I do not think it is fair for someone who only discovers #1 to get credit for the attack here.

## Impact

Anyone can steal all collateral from all defaulted loans.

## Code Snippet

Notice the lack of check for currency or originator of defaulting loans, totalCollateral incremented in unchecked block.

## Recommendation

Ensure that all loans passed to claimDefaulted are Clearinghouse-originated.
