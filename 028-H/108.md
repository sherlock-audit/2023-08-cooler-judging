# calling `claimDefault` function from the cooler contract of the clearingHouse loans will cause the `gOHM` tokens to be locked forever .
## severity 
high 

## Summary
if a user call the function `claimDefault()` on the cooler of the #clearingHouse contract , the gOHM tokens, that will be repaid to the clreaingHouse contract as collateral of the defaulted loan ,will not be handled inside the contract and will be locked forever . 
## Vulnerability Detail
in the clearingHouse contract the function `claimDefaulted()` handle the amount of `gOHM` tokens that are coming from the cooler contract as the collateral of the default loans , 
this function handle these tokens in this code snippet :
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Clearinghouse.sol#L241-L244
```solidity
         gOHM.transfer(msg.sender, keeperRewards);
        // Unstake and burn the collateral of the defaulted loans.
        gOHM.approve(address(staking), totalCollateral - keeperRewards);
        MINTR.burnOhm(address(this), staking.unstake(address(this), totalCollateral - keeperRewards, false, false));
```
this code snippet only exist in the function `claimDefaulted` and this is the only code that handle the gOHM tokens by unstaking them and then burn the `OHM` tokens . 

the vulnerability arises when the user call the function `claimDefaulted()` from  the cooler ,that  deals with the clearingHouse contract , not from the clearingHouse itself , so in this case the collateral of `gOHM` tokens will be sent to the clreaingHouse contract , the function `claimDefaulted()` from  the cooler will try to call the `_onDefault()` function which does not have any logic to perform , so **the gOHM tokens did not get handled and they get locked inside the clearingHouse contract forever** . 
as shown here the `_onDefault` function has no logic to perform .

here the function `claimDefaulted` from the cooler try to call the `onDefault` function :

## Impact
this vulnerability will lead to loss of funds for the protocol and the `gOHM` tokens because  when loan defaults, the treasury has lost that DAI to its backing, so the collateral should be taken and burnt , and this vulnerability will lead to the funds to be locked inside this contract forever .

## Tool used

Manual Review , vscode 

## Recommendation
add a logic to the function `onDefault()` inside the clearingHouse contract to handle the amount of `gOHM` tokens which coming from calling the `claimDefaulted` on the cooler contract to be equivalent to calling the `claimDefaulted()` function of the clearingHouse contract . 
```solidity
 function _onDefault(uint256, uint256, uint256) internal override {
uint256 amount = gOHM.balanceOf(address(this));
        gOHM.approve(address(staking), amount);
        MINTR.burnOhm(address(this), staking.unstake(address(this), amount, false, false));
}
```
