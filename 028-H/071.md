# ClaimDefaulted can be called on a loans that was created by a lender who is not the clearingHouse as long as it is from a valid cooler pool
## Summary

`claimDefaulted` accounts for/updates variables assuming that all the defaulted loans were taken by the ClearingHouse. However, any loan can be inputted into the `claimDefaulted` arrays. This can break the accounting of the Clearing house in multiple ways including:

- incorrect receivables
- overallocation of keeper rewards
- more debt owed to treasury

## Vulnerability Detail

The `claimDefaulted` function takes in any array of Cooler contracts and their corresponding Loans.

For each loan, the only validation done is that the loan came from a trusted cooler factory:

```solidity
        for (uint256 i=0; i < loans;) {
            // Validate that cooler was deployed by the trusted factory.
            if (!factory.created(coolers_[i])) revert OnlyFromFactory();
```

There is no validation that it was the clearinghouse that made the loan.

This is incorrect as the peer-to-peer loans allowed by the Cooler contract do not involve the clearing house. However there is a large amount of variables that are updated by the cooler contract, accounting as if it was a clearinghouse loan:

```solidity
        receivables = (receivables > totalDebt) ? receivables - totalDebt : 0;
        // Update outstanding debt owed to the Treasury upon default.
        uint256 outstandingDebt = TRSRY.reserveDebt(dai, address(this));
        // debt owed to TRSRY = user debt - user interest
        TRSRY.setDebt({
            debtor_: address(this),
            token_: dai,
            amount_: (outstandingDebt > (totalDebt - totalInterest))
                ? outstandingDebt - (totalDebt - totalInterest)
                : 0
        });


        // Reward keeper.
        gOHM.transfer(msg.sender, keeperRewards);
        // Unstake and burn the collateral of the defaulted loans.
        gOHM.approve(address(staking), totalCollateral - keeperRewards);
        MINTR.burnOhm(address(this), staking.unstake(address(this), totalCollateral - keeperRewards, false, false));
```

We can see that gOHM keeper rewards are sent to keeper for loans that clearing house was not responsible for. So the clearing house awards others for liquidating a loan the clearinghouse was never involved in.

`MINTR.burnOhm` is called, even though the peer-to-peer defaulted loans do not affect balances in the Clearing House



## Impact

**Treasury Debt Update:** The debt owed to the Treasury (TRSRY) would be incorrectly updated, potentially leading to imbalances in the financial accounting for the entire system.

**Receivables:** The contract's receivables variable would be incorrectly decremented, leading to inaccurate accounting metrics.

**Collateral Unstaking and Burning:** The contract will attempt to unstake and burn collateral that should not have been included, affecting the overall collateral pool.

Keeper Rewards: The keeper rewards would also be skewed, as they are calculated based on the collateral and elapsed time since default for each loan.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

There should be a check that the loans only originated from the Clearing House for any loan in the array inputted in the `ClaimDefaulted` function. Peer-to-peer loans that do not involve the clearing house should not change the internal accounting or involve any ohm transfers or interaction with MINTR or TRSRY
