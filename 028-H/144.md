# Anyone can set the Clearinghouse's debt to 0, fictitiously destroying the treasury's reserves, and enabling a Soros-style attack that could destroy Olympus
## Summary

Because `Clearinghouse.claimDefaulted` checks neither the owner nor currency of the defaulted loans, it is possible for anyone to set the Clearinghouse's debt to the treasury to 0. Through a chain of events, this destroys both the cushion and wall Ohm price protections, making it much easier for Ohm prices to escape the range. On the whole, it lowers the protocol's liquidity and makes it much easier to destroy the price, similar to what happened with Terra.

## Vulnerability Detail

While the exploit is simple and involves entirely in-scope code, understanding the chain of events that leads to attacker gain / Olympus harm requires significant knowledge of Olympus and market dynamics.

But the simple version is: The attacker can artificially lower the liquidity of the protocol, making it much easier to crash  (or explode) the price, similar to how liquidity being tied up eased the Soros-style attack on Terra. https://beincrypto.com/terras-ust-de-pegging-a-brilliant-soros-style-attack-claims-analyst/  . So one outcome: the attacker borrows a lot of Ohm, sells it and uses this exploit to break through the lower wall of Ohm, causing a selling panic that lowers it further, and thus makes a hefty profit on their short position (while potentially destroying the protocol). Further, as long as Cooler is operational, any Ohm holder will be incentivized to cash out by taking a Cooler loan for 3000 DAI/gOhm, allowing the attacker to erase that from the treasury as well, making the liquidity even lower, up until the point where the Cooler fund is exhausted and a real panic begins and the Ohm price crashes.

The range-bound stability system used by Olympus is explained at https://docs.olympusdao.finance/main/overview/range-bound/ . The whitepaper ( https://tinyurl.com/rbswhitepaper ) explains how it is very important that the treasury has ample liquidity to resist price movements, something that this exploit breaks.

### Part 1: Market conditions

1. Alice sees the price of Ohm is trending towards the lower or upper cushion. At the time of writing, these are $10.49 and $12.19, respectively. Ohm has traded below the lower cushion as recently as May.

2. Alice notices that a significant fraction of Olympus's treasury is deployed in Cooler loans. Note that this appears to be the intention, as online discussions of Cooler consider it a way for Ohm-holders to gain liquidity and encourage everyone using it. Also, the Clearinghouse has a fund size of $18M, which is approximately 10% of the OlympusDAO treasury's liquid backing (see https://app.olympusdao.finance/#/dashboard ), **and** the fund gets replenished to $18M every week (see Clearinghouse.rebalance). Also, the relevant number is not the total liquid backing, but the treasury's DAI reserves, currently $134M.

Let's suppose for the rest of the example that the Olympus treasury contains $130M DAI, of which $65M is deployed as Cooler loans.

### Part 2: The exploit

4. Alice creates a loan to herself in some made-up currency. She picks an amount such that amount-interest is very close to 65M. She sets loanToCollateral sufficiently high that the collateral is 0, and sets the duration to 0.

5. Alice passes this loan into Clearinghouse.claimDefaulted. Because this method checks neither the originator nor currency of this loan, it treats it as if someone had just defaulted on a loan of approximately 65M DAI.

6. The Clearinghouse sets its debt to the treasury to 65M-(amount-interest), a number very close to 0. See https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Clearinghouse.sol#L232

At this point, the exploit is done. However, understanding its effects now requires going deeper into Olympus.

### Part 3: The immediate effects

7. The call to setDebt makes TRSRY.totalDebt[dai] 65M lower than it should be.  As a result, treasury.getReserveBalance(dai) is 65M instead of 130M. See https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-v3/blob/master/src/modules/TRSRY/OlympusTreasury.sol#L179 . The capacity of the range-bound system is based on this number, for each of the high cushion, high wall, low cushion, and low wall.  See https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-v3/blob/master/src/policies/Operator.sol#L826 .

### Part 4: The wall and the cushion

8. The Ohm market continues its trend towards the upper or lower cushion price, perhaps aided by some price manipulation by Alice.

9.  The cushion is hit, and a bond market opens. However, it closes prematurely.  Ohm continues to rise/drop past the cushion.

10. The wall is hit, and also closes prematurely.

11. If it's the lower wall that was hit: Everyone who owns Ohm cashes out by taking a Cooler loan until Cooler is shut down or drained. Alice again erases that debt from the treasury, restricting the liquidity of the wall and cushion further.

12. A panic ensues, and Olympus becomes the next Terra.

### The most extreme sudden drop possible

Suppose the treasury has 60M in reserves, 60M in receivables on Cooler loans. 

A well-funded attacker could take out 18M in loans right before a rebalance, and then in the very next block take out another 18M in loans, and then in the same transaction default on a 96M loan for a made-up coin, thereby wiping the apparent reserves from 120M to 24M in seconds.

### Note on a negative cascade

Having the treasury report an artificially lower reserve can lead to a cascade where Ohm/gOhm holders panic and use Cooler to cash out their Ohm for 3000 DAI/gOhm, enabling Alice to artificially lower the apparent reserves more, causing more Ohm-holders to cash out with Coooler loans, eventually leading to the death of the protocol (unless hitting the emergency shutdown on Cooler can stop it).

### Variant with price manipulation

If Alice is a whale and able to acquire a significant fraction of the gOhm supply, or forms a conspiracy of existing Ohm-whales, then Alice can herself both artificially decrease the treasury's apparent reserves (by using this exploit) and artificially increase the reserves (by paying the loans back, which is not supposed to change the reserves by more than 0.5%), allowing her to effectively turn the cushion and wall off and on almost like a switch.

### To make it worse

The capacity of the range-bound system is based on the sum of the Treasury's holdings in DAI and the debt to it in DAI.  However, rebalance() pays back the debt in sDAI. This means that repaying loans does not actually increase the capacity of markets until some other process converts the sDAI into DAI.

### Background

**Ohm wall and cushion**

Call `getTargetPrice()` at https://etherscan.io/address/0xd6C4D723fdadCf0D171eF9A2a3Bfa870675b282f#readContract to see that the current target price is $11.34 (11.34 DAI/Ohm).

Call `range()` at https://etherscan.io/address/0xb212d9584cfc56eff1117f412fe0bbdc53673954/advanced#readContract to see that the current cushion spread is 750 (7.5%) and wall spread is 1500 (15%).

This gives lower and upper cushion prices of $11.34 / 0.925= $10.49 and $11.34*1.075 =$12.19.

Similarly, lower and upper wall prices are $11.34 / 0.85= $9.64 and $11.34*1.15 =$13.04. These can be corroborated in https://app.olympusdao.finance/#/range

**DAI reserves**

Go to https://etherscan.io/address/0xa8687A15D4BE32CC8F0a8a7B9704a4C3993D9613#readContract and call `getReserveBalance(address addr)`  with the address of DAI, `0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f` .  At the time of writing, the answer is 134179755028726760537032171, i.e.: $134M.

**Details about activating and deactivating the wall and cushion**

*  `beat()` is called on the OlympusHeart every 8 hours. See https://etherscan.io/address/0x9c6220fe829d6fc889cde9b4966d2033c4effd48/ . If it isn't called automatically, anyone can call it. `Heart.beat()` then calls `Operator.operate()`. https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-v3/blob/master/src/policies/Heart.sol#L98



* `Operator.operate()` checks if the current Ohm market price is above or below the target price (currently $11.34). If it has been above or below for 18 of the last 21 heartbeats, and it has been at least 6 days since the last time _regenerate was called, then it resets the capacity of the RANGE to 10% of the current treasury DAI reserve (which has been manipulated by this exploit). See https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-v3/blob/master/src/policies/Operator.sol#L201 and https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-v3/blob/master/src/policies/Operator.sol#L826 . (It has been trading well below that price, meaning that it is indeed regenerating every 6 days.)

* The capacity of the wall changes on every trade. If it falls below 1% of what the capacity was at the start of the 6-day cycle, then the wall deactivates. See https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-v3/blob/master/src/modules/RANGE/OlympusRange.sol#L91 . So, if the Treasury has 100M reserves+debt, but reports only 10M thanks to this exploit, then capacity will be 1M, and the wall will deactivate after only 990k of sales, instead of 9.9M.

* A bond market will open when the price falls below the lower cushion or rises above the upper cushion. See https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-v3/blob/master/src/policies/Operator.sol#L248 .  The market capacity is set to the capacity set in _regenerate times the cushion factor, which is currently 30%. On the whole, the market capacity will be 3% of the number reported by TRSRY.getReserveBalance. See https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-v3/blob/master/src/policies/Operator.sol#L449  .  The cushionFactor is the first value of config, and can be read at https://etherscan.io/address/0x1ce568dbb34b2631acdb5b453c3195ea0070ec65/advanced#readContract .



## Impact

It is much easier for Ohm to escape its range bound. There is also the possibility of a cascade that bankrupts the DAO.
