# Lender cannot cancel their new terms request
## Summary
Lender cannot cancel their new terms request

## Vulnerability Detail
When a loan is active, the lender can propose new terms for it. If they're suitable, the borrower may accept them. The problem is there is lack of functionality allowing for the lender to withdraw their proposed new terms. This means that if they propose new terms, which after some time turn significantly unfavorable for them, they cannot cancel/ withdraw them and the user can simply accept them and force the lender into an unfavorable loan.

## Impact
Lender can be forced into an unfavorable loan.
