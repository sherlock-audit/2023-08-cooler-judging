# repayLoan can be DOSSed
## Summary
repayLoan triggers the callback (if set to true) of the `repayLoan` function. This enables a lender to revert everytime the borrower is trying to repay
## Vulnerability Detail
When clearing a request, the lender indicates the callback value:

which is then tested:

This callback is also triggered at the end of the `repayLoan` function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol#L185

The lender could simply clear the request with a contract where it's possible to toggle the result of the callback function (revert or succeed).

Usually when a loan is created, the collateral value is higher than the borrowed amount. This would incentivize the lender to perform this action (where the requested amount < collateral amount).
## Impact
`repayLoan` DOSSed where the borrower cant repay his loan and is defaulted.

## Recommendation
Rethink the way you're using the callback function. Optionally send the repayAmount to the contract where `claim` always needs to be called.
