# LendToCooler access control can be bypassed
## Summary

The check for the `lendToCooler() `function is meant to restrict it to only Coolers created by the factory. This can be bypassed by creating a Cooler which conforms to the interface but returns a factory where `.created()` returns `true`

## Vulnerability Detail

There is a check in `lendToCooler` which restricts the cooler inputs to only coolers created by the ClearingHouse:

```solidity
 if (!factory.created(address(cooler_))) revert OnlyFromFactory();
```

factory just calls the `factory()` function in cooler.

As long as you have:
1. a malicious cooler which returns a malicious factory
2. a malicious factory which conforms to the implicit interface but returns true for the check  `if (!factory.created(address(cooler_))) revert OnlyFromFactory();`

the check can by bypassed

Once the check is bypassed malicious loans can be created which set interestRate, LoanToCollateral and Duration which is extremely unfavorable to the ClearingHouse, thus draining the contract.

## Impact

- The contract can be drained through malicious loans
- The ClearingHouse is forced to take loans from malicious coolers

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Have the correct cooler addresses stored in the ClearingHouse contract and have a check that the Cooler input corresponds to these stored addresses.
