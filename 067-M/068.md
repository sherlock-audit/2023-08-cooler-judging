# The `interestFromDebt` Function Does not Account for the Rolled Loans
## Summary
The formula within the `interestFromDebt` function consistently uses the `DURATION` constant, neglecting to consider rolled loans which have an extended duration of `n * DURATION`. This oversight results in miscalculations regarding interest.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `claimDefaulted` function of the contract employs the `interestFromDebt` function to determine the interest the protocol should have garnered upon repayment.

```javascript
    function interestFromDebt(uint256 debt_) public pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 interestPercent = (INTEREST_RATE * DURATION) / 365 days;
        return debt_ * interestPercent / 1e18;
    }
```

This formula does not account for loans that have been rolled over, which would have a duration of `n * DURATION`, where n is the number of times the loan has been rolled over.

The error arises from the formula's design, which calculates the interest that will accumulate on a specific debt without considering the actual duration for rolled loans.

## Impact
The incorrect calculation can lead to financial discrepancies in the protocol for rolled loans.

## Recommendation
Modify the `interestFromDebt` function to account for the actual duration of the loan, especially for rolled loans. The formula should consider the number of times a loan has been rolled over.
