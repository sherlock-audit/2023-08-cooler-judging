# Any `gOHM` in clearinghouse can be stolen.
## Summary

Any `gOHM` in clearinghouse can be stolen.

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract `Clearinghouse` is used to fulfill loan requests. This contract handles the tokens gOHM, DAI and sDAI. If there is any gOHM tokens in the contract, it can be stolen by anyone.

The `claimDefaulted` contract claims defaulted loans, and pays the `msg.sender` a reward in `gOHM`. However, the contract never checks if they were the lender of that loan in the first place. Thus this function can be called by anyone with the info of any expired loan to claim rewards.

```solidity
 for (uint256 i=0; i < loans;) {
    // Validate that cooler was deployed by the trusted factory.
    if (!factory.created(coolers_[i])) revert OnlyFromFactory();
```

The above for loop loops over the passed list of coolers and loans. The only check it does is that the cooler was created by the factory. It does not check if the clearinghouse was the lender of the loan. Lets assume an attacker creates a loan request and then fulfills it themselves, and the time for liquidation has come. This check will pass, since the factory does in fact track the particular cooler contract. The contract then calls `claimDefaulted` on the cooler contract.

```solidity
function claimDefaulted(uint256 loanID_) external returns (uint256, uint256, uint256) {
    Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];
    delete loans[loanID_];


    if (block.timestamp <= loan.expiry) revert NoDefault();


    // Transfer defaulted collateral to the lender.
    collateral().safeTransfer(loan.lender, loan.collateral);


    // Log the event.
    factory().newEvent(loanID_, CoolerFactory.Events.DefaultLoan, 0);


    // If necessary, trigger lender callback.
    if (loan.callback) CoolerCallback(loan.lender).onDefault(loanID_, loan.amount, loan.collateral);
    return (loan.amount, loan.collateral, block.timestamp - loan.expiry);
}
```

Inside the `claimDefaulted` function, we see that the collateral is sent to the `loan.lender`, which in this case is the attacker themselves. So the attacker gets the collateral, since this function can be called by anyone, and in this instance it is being called by the clearing house.

After the liquidation, the clearing house calculates a reward and pays the `msg.sender`.

```solidity
keeperRewards = (elapsed < 7 days)
    ? keeperRewards + maxReward * elapsed / 7 days
    : keeperRewards + maxReward;
gOHM.transfer(msg.sender, keeperRewards);
```

However the clearinghouse was not the lender, and thus didnt get the colalteral. So if there is any gOHM in the clearinghouse, the attacker will be paid out a part of it as rewards.

## Impact

Any gOHM in the clearinghouse contract can be claimed by any attacker.

## Recommendation

Add a check that the clearing house is in fact the lender for the loan being defaulted.
