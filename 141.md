# Borrower cannot repay if lender prevent it
## Summary
`Cooler.sol` can be used without `ClearingFactory.sol`. In that situation, cooler owner will use `requestLoan()` function and users will give debt token to make interest.If this loan expire before borrower repay, lender can take collateral of owner by using `claimDefaulted()`.  The vulnerability is loanLender can be a contract which revert when `onRepay` callback use to it.By this way malicious lender can take all colleteral eventhough borrower want to repay before expire.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    function clearRequest(
        uint256 reqID_,
        bool repayDirect_,
        bool isCallback_
    ) external returns (uint256 loanID) {
      ...

        loans.push(
            Loan({
                request: req,
                amount: req.amount + interest,
                unclaimed: 0,
                collateral: collat,
                expiry: expiration,
                lender: msg.sender,
                repayDirect: repayDirect_,
                callback: isCallback_
            })
        );

        ...
```
```solidity
        if (loan.callback) CoolerCallback(loan.lender).onRepay(loanID_, repaid_);//In repayLoan function
```
As can be seen loan.lender can set `isCallback` true for use `onRepay()` callback. If loan.lender revert in onRepay anytime called.Than borrower cannot repay his loan and lender will take borrower's collateral.
