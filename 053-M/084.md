# Early Claim Advantage in `claimDefaulted` Rewards Distribution
## Summary
The `claimDefaulted` function's rewards distribution in the provided contract favors users who claim defaulted loans shortly after defaulting, potentially leading to an uneven distribution of rewards and an advantage for early claimants.
## Vulnerability Detail
The rewards distribution mechanism calculates rewards based on the elapsed time since the loans defaulted. This results in users who claim defaulted loans earlier receiving higher rewards compared to those who claim later. The distribution model can create an incentive for early claimants, potentially leading to an exploitable advantage.
```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < loans;) {
    // ...

    // Calculate rewards based on the elapsed time since default.
    keeperRewards = (elapsed < 7 days)
        ? keeperRewards + maxReward * elapsed / 7 days
        : keeperRewards + maxReward;

    // ...
}

```
## Impact
Early claimants could receive disproportionately high rewards, while users who claim later may receive significantly lower rewards for similar defaulted loans.

## Recommendation
Rewards could be distributed based on factors such as the severity of the defaulted loan, the total number of defaulted loans claimed, or an equal distribution regardless of claim timing. This would prevent users from gaming the system by timing their claims to gain an advantage.
