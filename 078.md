# Attacker May Exploit Recursive DAI Withdrawal in `lendToCooler` Transaction"
## Summary
The `lendToCooler` function's withdrawal operation can introduce a risk due to its interaction with an external contract. Attackers may exploit this vulnerability to execute malicious actions during a transaction, potentially leading to unauthorized access and loss of funds.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `lendToCooler` function includes a line of code that interacts with an external contract (sdai) to withdraw funds:
```solidity
sdai.withdraw(amount_, address(this), address(this));
```
In this context, sdai is expected to be an idle token representing a user's share of an underlying asset, such as DAI, in a savings account. The function initiates a withdrawal from the savings account and transfers the funds to the contract's address `(address(this))`.
Attack Scenario:
1. An attacker initiates a lending transaction by calling the `lendToCooler` function.
2. Within the function, the `sdai.withdraw` operation transfers funds to the contract's address.
3. Before the withdrawal operation completes, the attacker's malicious contract reenters the `lendToCooler` function.
4. The attacker's contract can execute additional code, potentially calling other contract functions or interacting with state variables.
## Impact
Malicious exploitation may result in loss or manipulation of user-owned assets, potentially compromising their financial security.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate the reentrancy risk, implement the ReentrancyGuard pattern or other protection mechanisms. These mechanisms prevent reentrant calls by using locks to ensure that external contracts cannot manipulate the contract's state until the current operation is completed.
