# A lender can intentionally fail the onRepay callback to induce a default
## Summary

The default can be induced by the lender intentionally reverting the `onRepay` callback.

## Vulnerability Detail

If the price of the dept token drops significantly, the lender may want to take the collateral token. In the onRepay callback, lender can intentionally revert function and prevent further debt repayment, so that can get more collateral token instead of debt token.

The lender can use a contract that checks the price and fails `onRepay` if lender want, or can upgrade the contract to fail `onRepay` if contract was upgradeable. Lender can also use the `transferOwnership` function to change to a lender that does not have a callback function or to EOA.

```solidity
function repayLoan(uint256 loanID_, uint256 repaid_) external returns (uint256) {
	...
        if (loan.callback) CoolerCallback(loan.lender).onRepay(loanID_, repaid_);
        return decollateralized;
}
```

## Impact

A lender can intentionally cause a default.
