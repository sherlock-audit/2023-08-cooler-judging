# Lender can prevent borrower from repaying the loan
## Summary
Lender can make the callback revert and prevent borrower from repaying the loan. This way lender can guarantee to get the collateral if they consider it more valuable then the loan amount.

## Vulnerability Detail
Lender can choose to have a callback when giving out a loan.
```solidity
    function clearRequest(
        uint256 reqID_,
        bool repayDirect_,
        bool isCallback_
    ) external returns (uint256 loanID) {
```
Then, when borrower tries to repay, the callback is being invoked
```solidity
if (loan.callback) CoolerCallback(loan.lender).onRepay(loanID_, repaid_);
```

Lender has full control over the callback contract. They can have it revert, making it impossible to repay the loan.

## Impact
Lender can freely exchange debt for collateral and borrower has no way to prevent this.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I advise to remove callback functionality. However, if it is absolutely necessary, make a [low-level call ](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/solidity-call) when invoking a callback which allows to swallow the error.
