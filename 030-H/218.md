# Malicious lender can prevent borrowers from repaying their loans.
## Summary
Malicious lenders can prevent borrowers from repaying their loans using the `onRepay` function in the `CoolerCallback` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a malicious lender sees a loan request that they want to clear, they will use the `clearRequest` function and pass the `isCallback_` argument as true. When the borrower tries to repay the loan(`repayLoan`), the code enters the following line and calls the `onRepay` function on the lender:
```solidity
if (loan.callback) CoolerCallback(loan.lender).onRepay(loanID_, repaid_);
```
The `onRepay` function further calls the `_onRepay` internal function which can be defined in any possible manner. It could run an infinite loop causing out-of-gas errors or simply revert. It could be defined simply like this:

```solidity
function _onRepay(uint256 loanID_, uint256 amount_) internal virtual override{
  revert("always reverts");
}
```
In this way, this `onRepay` function which is called when a borrower invokes the `repayLoan` function will always revert.

## Impact
The borrower is never able to repay their loans. The lender is able to claim the collateral after the loan's expiry. Will be possible in cases where the loan-to-collateral ratio is low.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Maybe the protocol could limit the amount of gas that is sent to the `onRepay` function. Also, the project should check to see if the callback functions revert by wrapping it in a try-catch block.
