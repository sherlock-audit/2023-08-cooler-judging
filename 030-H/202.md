# Loan forced to default if Lender creates onRepay callback that reverts
## Summary

Lender can force their own `onRepay` callback to always revert whenever borrower tries to `repayLoan`, thus never allowing the borrower to repay the loan and seizing the borrower's collateral after the loan defaults. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Note that clearRequest in `Cooler.sol` looks like this:

```solidity
    function clearRequest(
        uint256 reqID_,
        bool repayDirect_,
        bool isCallback_
    ) external returns (uint256 loanID) {
```

First, assume that a borrower has created a loan request directly through the Cooler by calling `requestLoan`. The lender should call `clearRequest` with `isCallback_ = true`. The lender should have a `isCoolerCallback()` function which returns true and thus bypasses this check in `clearRequest`:

```solidity
if (isCallback_ && !CoolerCallback(msg.sender).isCoolerCallback()) revert NotCoolerCallback();
```

Now, whenever the borrower attempts to call `repayLoan`, the following will be called:

```solidity
if (loan.callback) CoolerCallback(loan.lender).onRepay(loanID_, repaid_);
```

The lender should simply have `onRepay` revert, ensuring that the borrower will never be able to repay the loan. The lender can then seize the borrower's collateral after the loan inevitably defaults. 

## Impact

Lender will be able to force the loan to default and seize the borrower's collateral.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Only allow repay callback for the clearing house or use a low level call instead and ignore if it reverts (though this might not be good for the clearing house's use case).
