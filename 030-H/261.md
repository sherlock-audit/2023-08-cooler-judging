# a malicious lender can prevent the borrower from repaying there debt
## Summary
due to the the logic where a lender can trigger a callback when the **borrower** repay a **malicious** **lender** can stop the **borrower** from paying by reverting when there **onRepay** function is called 
## Vulnerability Detail
when filling a borrow request using **clearRequest**  the function takes a *isCallback_* argument which is used to check if the lender want to be called when the borrower repay the loan and the function checks if the lender  implemented    the  proper function by 
doing 
`        if (isCallback_ && !CoolerCallback(msg.sender).isCoolerCallback()) revert NotCoolerCallback();
`
and in the function **repayLoan** if **isCallback** is **true** it will try to call 
`        if (loan.callback) CoolerCallback(loan.lender).onRepay(loanID_, repaid_);
`
so what a malicious lender  can do  is to always revert when the function **onRepay** is called so the user will not be able to repay there loan so that the malicious user can take the full collateral 
## Impact
loss of fund for the borrower
