# Malicious Lender Callback Prevents Repayments in Cooler.sol
## Summary
In the `Cooler.sol` contract, a malicious lender can exploit the callback mechanism to obstruct repayments. By activating the callback option and using a contract address that implements a consistently reverting `onRepay` method, the lender can force defaulting of the borrower that is using the Cooler contract, irrespective of the ClearingHouse's actions.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `repayLoan` function in the `Cooler.sol` contract allows for a callback mechanism where the lender's `onRepay` method is invoked. If a malicious lender uses a contract address as their lending address and this contract has an `onRepay` method designed to revert every time it's called, it will prevent any repayments from being processed.

```javascript
if (loan.callback) CoolerCallback(loan.lender).onRepay(loanID_, repaid_);
```
If the `onRepay` method of the `CoolerCallback` contract (represented by the lender's address) is designed to always revert, then the entire `repayLoan` transaction will fail, effectively blocking the borrower from repaying their loan.

## Impact
Borrowers will be unable to repay their loans, leading to guaranteed defaults even if they have the necessary funds to repay.

## Recommendation
Consider using a low level `call` and correctly handle the case when the lender reverts to allow the lender to repay.
