# Malicious lenders can prevent borrowers from repaying through callback functions
## Summary

A malicious lender can set a malicious callback function. During the loan period, if the price of collateral is found to be rising or the price of debt token is falling, the malicious callback function can be used to prevent the borrower from repaying.

Malicious callback functions are also easy to implement. You can set a global variable, and then function A can set whether the global variable is true or false, and then check whether the global variable is true in the callback function to decide whether to revert
