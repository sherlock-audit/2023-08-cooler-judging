# a malicious lender can activate the callback and revert inside the `onRepay()` callback, which will force the loan become default.
## Summary
the lender can set the `callback` to be true and then make the `onRepay()` callback to revert which will prevent the borrower from repaying the loan , and this will lead to the force the loan become default and the borrower will loss his collateral . 

## Vulnerability Detail
when the lender accept the terms of the request , he call the function `clearRequest()` to send the debt tokens and activate the loan . 
the lender can pass `true ` in the `callback` parameter . which means that the functions `repayLoan()` and `claimdefaulted()` and `rollLoan()` will callback the lender contract and execute one of the callbacks `onRepay()` or `onDefault()` or `onRoll()` , the function `clearRequest()` make sure that the lender contract inherit the callback contract  by calling this function `isCoolerCallback()` on the lender contract  , as shown here : 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol#L241
the `isCoolerCallback` always returns true 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/CoolerCallback.sol#L25-L27

so , when the borrower wants to repay the loan the function `repayLoan()` will make an external call to the function `onRepay()` on the lender contract and execute its logic , as shown here : 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-08-cooler/blob/main/Cooler/src/Cooler.sol#L185-L186

so when the value of the collateral increased ,  the malicious lender can revert inside the function `onRepay()` which will prevent the borrower from repaying the loan , and the loan become default , then the lender take the collateral . 
the contract of the lender should contain this function to prevent the borrower from repaying the loan 
```solidity
function onRepay(uint256 x, uint256 y ) external {
   revert();
} 
```

## Impact
loss of funds of the borrower , allow the malicious lender to force the loan become default  , and take the collateral of the borrower .

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1) remove the callback functions . 
2) split the logic of calling the callback from the `repayLoan` function.
3) add a function to allow the lender to execute the callback manually .
