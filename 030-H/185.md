# Malicious lender may implement the _onRepay() and _onRollLoan() function to revert and force the loan to be defaulted

## Summary

The `CoolerCallback` abstract is intended to allow debt issuers to execute logic when a loan is repaid, rolled, or defaulted. 

In the provided example of how they expect this callback to be used, this would result in the opportunity for a denial of service on the `repayLoan()` and `rollLoan()` functions.

The malicious lender may implement the `_onRepay()` and `_onRollLoan()` functions to always be reverted on execution and the `repayLoan()` and `rollLoan()` methods will fail. Finally, the loan will default.

Without implementing anything in the `_onDefault()` function, the malicious lender can call the `claimDefaulted()` to claim collateral without fail.

## Impact

The lender forced the Loan become default to get the collateral token, owner lost the collateral token.

## Recommendation

Only allowing callbacks from the protocol-trusted address (eg., `Clearinghouse` contract).
