# Malicious lender can scam borrower by increasing the interest way too much after loan being issued and take borrower's collateral.
## Summary
In `Cooler.sol` , `provideNewTermsForRoll` function is used to update the loan with new terms . Only lender can call the function . 
And the `rollLoan` function is used to update the terms of the loan . Anybody can call  the function but have to pay the excess collateral . 

This arises an exploit scenario where a malicious lender can increase the interest way too much by calling  `provideNewTermsForRoll` function and updating the loan terms by calling  `rollLoan` function .Malicious borrower will only update the interest so that he doesnot have to pay any extra collateral while calling `rollLoan` function . 

 If this occurs , borrower will be unable to repay the debt as it increases too much . Malicious lender will claim borrowers collateral after the loan gets defaulted(expired) and profit (loans are overcollateralized) . And the borrower got scammed ! 


## Vulnerability Detail
see summary 
`provideNewTermsForRoll` function looks like this : 
```solidity 

 function provideNewTermsForRoll(
        uint256 loanID_,
        uint256 interest_,
        uint256 loanToCollateral_,
        uint256 duration_
    ) external {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanID_];

        if (msg.sender != loan.lender) revert OnlyApproved();

        loan.request =
            Request(
                loan.amount,
                interest_, //<-------Malicious lender increases it too much 
                loanToCollateral_,
                duration_,
                true
            );
    }
```


`rollLoan` function looks like this : 
```solidity 
 function rollLoan(uint256 loanID_) external { //<----updates the terms by calling this .
        Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];

        if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) revert Default();
        if (!loan.request.active) revert NotRollable();

        // Check whether rolling the loan requires pledging more collateral or not (if there was a previous repayment).
        uint256 newCollateral = newCollateralFor(loanID_);
        uint256 newDebt = interestFor(loan.amount, loan.request.interest, loan.request.duration);

        // Update memory accordingly.
        loan.amount += newDebt; //< ------- now debt is increased too much to repay 
        loan.collateral += newCollateral;
        loan.expiry += loan.request.duration;
        loan.request.active = false;

        // Save updated loan info in storage.
        loans[loanID_] = loan;

        if (newCollateral > 0) {
            collateral().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newCollateral);
        }

        // If necessary, trigger lender callback.
        if (loan.callback) CoolerCallback(loan.lender).onRoll(loanID_, newDebt, newCollateral);
    }

```

## Recommendation
Multiple options are there to mitigate the issue : 
1. Define a maxInterestRate constant and checks everytime if provided interest maintains that or not .
2. Let the borrower confirm the new terms provided .
