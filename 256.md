# Malicious Lender can force default by not accepting tokens.
## Summary

While repaying the loan, malicious lender can refuse to take the tokens (in case in blocklist) to force borrower to default.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `repay` function, debt tokens can be transferred directly to lender in case lender has enabled `loan.repayDirect`.

```solidity

  function repayLoan(uint256 loanID_, uint256 repaid_) external returns (uint256) {
      Loan memory loan = loans[loanID_];
      // -------- SNIP --------- //

      if (loan.repayDirect) {
          repayTo = loan.lender;
      } else {
          repayTo = address(this);
          loan.unclaimed += repaid_;
      }

      // Save updated loan info in storage.
      loans[loanID_] = loan;

@->   debt().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, repayTo, repaid_); // @audit-issue Lender can refuse to accept.
      collateral().safeTransfer(owner(), decollateralized);

      // -------- SNIP --------- //
  }

```

This can be problematic in following situation:

1. Alice has taken a loan where `loan.repayDirect` is set to `true`.
2. Alice wants to repay the loan amount. So she calls `repayLoan`.
3. Lender address can be in blocklist which can result in transaction getting revert in the above code (At @-> position).
4. Given Alice can't repay now, She will be forced to default and Lender can take all the collateral by calling `transferOwnership` after the expiry followed by calling `claimDefaulted`.

This can lead to loss of funds for Alice.

## Impact

Borrower forced to default and lose collateral.

## Recommendation

Recommend to disable `repayDirect` option in `repay` function and allow the transfer of token only to contract while later lender can withdraw.
