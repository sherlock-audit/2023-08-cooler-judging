# If `loan.callback == true`, lender can force all repayments to revert and force loan into default
## Summary
If `loan.callback == true`, lender can force all repayments to revert and force loan into default

## Vulnerability Detail
Upon any repayment, if `loan.callback == true` a call to `CoolerCallback(loan.lender).onDefault(loanID_, loan.amount, loan.collateral);
` is made. The problem is that the lender can purposefully implement a faulty integration of the `CoolerCallback` interface which makes all calls to `onRepay` to revert and make all repayments revert too. By doing so, they will force the loan to go into default and will then be able to seize the borrower's collateral.
```solidity
        // If necessary, trigger lender callback.
        if (loan.callback) CoolerCallback(loan.lender).onRepay(loanID_, repaid_);
```

## Impact
Lender can steal the borrower's collateral

## Recommendation
